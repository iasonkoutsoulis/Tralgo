# Tralgo

Stands for **Tr**ading **algo**rithm, and is split into two main learning projects. First, the processing of human language and second, training it to produce forecasts on macroeconomic and financial timeseries.

##### Newspaper articles processing
We do some *web scraping* over available articles and process text via SciKit-learn.

##### Financial and macroeconomic inputs

Nothing is certain for now, but if this where to turn into a speculative algorithm a lot of things would need to be standardized.

### Neural Network training

I'll have to work on the data preprocessing first, after which point I hope this part will be straightforward to code (and a pain to train).
