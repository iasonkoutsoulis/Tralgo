One small retailer's profit warning does not a bleak Christmas make The analysts' working theory is this: big one-stop retailers, like the supermarkets and large department stores, win and the specialist stores lose. That sounds like a reasonable guess: why trawl around the high street in the snow when you can get more Christmas presents under one roof?

A Christmas rally? Plenty. The woes of the eurozone have been relegated to down-page status since the European Central Bank starting buying bonds aggressively a fortnight ago, but that doesn't mean the problems have gone away. There are several factors at work. One is anxiety about what the grand two-day EU summit, which starts on Thursday, will bring. The big question is whether the current bailout fund will be beefed up to a size capable of intimidating markets. Then there is a tricky issue of how to design a permanent crisis fund to work after 2013 and how to force investors to take "haircuts" or losses; these can be scary subjects for markets, as we saw in Ireland. The other factor gnawing away is the realisation that the return of inflation – if that's what we are witnessing – adds yet another layer of complexity. It's not just the hit to growth if borrowing costs rise. Quantitative easing, which markets have come to regard as the central bankers' panic button, even in the eurozone, becomes harder to activate. Shares can keep rising in such a climate, but, after such a strong December rally, it's probably not the way to bet if those Spanish bond yields keep climbing. The end of the year could yet be nervy.

Betfair: Goldman Sach's duffest flotation of the year Some high-rolling poker players have disappeared; horse-racing is declining in popularity; and gamblers are risking less when budgets are tight. These are minor complaints: it's just that there is a lot of them. At 990p, Betfair is obviously a more enticing prospect. Today's trading numbers were a setback but not a disaster: the core British business is well established and should still churn out decent sums of cash. But there is little clarity on the adventures into new territories – the US and financial markets – that were the other factor behind the princely float valuation. California will allow exchange wagering on horse-racing from May 2012. Fine, but let's see how the conservative, and powerful, American horse-racing lobby reacts. It is also far too early to say how the LMAX financial exchange will prosper – it's only been open for a few months. Until the picture becomes less fuzzy, putting a fair value on Betfair is an exercise in educated guesswork. There is room for honest disagreement. From the point of view of Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the sponsors to the float, the concern will be the behaviour of the insiders, Betfair's long-standing investors who still dominate the register. The first lock-up agreements come off next autumn. If the shares still stand well below £13 then, it would be embarrassing for the investment banks if there's a rush to sell.

Rights issues reform requires pressure on chief executives
 ~~~~ 
Inquiry calls for full disclosure rights issue fees   Companies which tap investors for cash should be required to provide a break-down of fees paid to investment banking advisors to stop them being overcharged, according to an inquiry into rights issues published today. The inquiry, led by a group of City investors, found that companies which conducted rights issues were charged fees that were 10 times more than they paid their own directors. The cost is ultimately borne by shareholders who are ordinary savers and investors in pension funds and who only receive an aggregate figure of fees paid. The inquiry could find no "plausible justification" for the rise in fees that has taken place since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission conducted an investigation into the issue 13 years ago, aside from the period during the banking crisis. Underwriting fees were 2% before the MMC, rose to 2.9% afterwards and hit an average of 3.4% in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The Office of Fair Trading launched an inquiry in June and is due to publish its findings next month. A record £49.4bn was raised by rights issues in 2009, smashing the pervious record in 2008 of £27bn when banks were forced to tap shareholders for cash. Douglas Ferrans, chairman of the Rights Issue Fees Inquiry (RIFI), said: "Companies are paying too much to ensure the deal is a success. On average companies who have had rights issues have paid ten times more in fees than that which was paid to their executive team in total reward. Whilst remuneration rightly comes under the spotlight, very little light is shone on these larger numbers." Leading City investors do not want to radically overhaul rights issues which allow existing shareholders the "right" to buy new shares being issued to prevent their influence being diluted by new investors arriving on the register. But Ferrans noted: "Companies and their shareholders are not getting a fair deal and that needs to change." The inquiry calls for fees paid for underwriting and advisory services to be disclosed to the stock market and in the next annual report. Companies should also consider whether they might only need to underwrite part of their issue to reduce the cost. One of the ways to do this is with greater consultation. This presents problems of putting insiders in receipt of information that could move a share price so the inquiry suggests that institutional shareholders should consider appointing those who can be taken "off market" to discuss such matters with companies. The inquiry was led by City investor groups including the Investment Management Association, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF). The Inquiry was commissioned by the Institutional Investor Council.

UK firms announce £2.4bn in takeover deals Dealmaking came back with a vengeance today as British companies announced takeover deals involving everything from oil pipes to Maximuscle protein drinks worth a total of £2.4bn. In a sign that companies are starting to spend the mountains of cash they have amassed after two years of hoarding and risk aversion, corporations such as pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, the cleaning products firm Reckitt Benckiser and Yule Catto, the chemicals maker, announced acquisition deals. The American conglomerate General Electric also succeeded in its third attempt to buy the British oil services firm Wellstream for £800m, further adding to the buoyant mood. The spate of deals pushed the FTSE 100 index up by 47 points, to close just short of a year high at 5860, promising a strong finale to 12 months that have gone down as the worst for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in more than a decade. Rhys Phillip, Ernst & Young's head of M&A for the UK and Ireland, said: "There is a lot more sentiment in the market for deals now and a lot more conversations taking place because companies have all this money flushing around and are looking for a reason to spend it." Among the main deals of the day, Glaxo has agreed to buy Maxinutrition, Europe's biggest sports nutrition company, from Darwin Private Equity for £162m. Reckitt Benckiser snapped up Paras Pharmaceuticals, an Indian ointments and personal care company, for $726m (£458m), while Yule Catto acquired PolymerLatex, Europe's third-largest latex maker, for €433m (£366m). However, Phillip, who has seen "steady growth" in deal activity in the past six months, which he expects to continue, warned that the increase is from a low base and that the recovery has some way to go. "I am not cracking open the champagne just yet. There is a lot more talk, but not quite so much action," he said, in the week after Burberry, J Sainsbury, Smith & Nephew, Kesa Electricals and G4S were all targets of takeover rumours that have yet to materialise. Some 466 of Europe's biggest companies – the Stoxx Europe 600 index, excluding its financial constituents – are sitting on $691bn of cash, according to Bloomberg. This represents a 16% increase on the amount they had at the end of 2007 as the financial crisis gained momentum and companies opted to hoard cash by cutting costs, dividends and deal activity. At the same time, it is relatively easy for companies to raise more cash since investor demand for bonds is strong, while the low base rate ensures interest is low. The UK oil services groups Wellstream and PSN also announced that they were being sold, as energy services companies grow increasingly confident about the future after a two-year slump and as the price of oil edges ever closer to $90 a barrel. General Electric has agreed to pay £800m for Wellstream, the world's biggest maker of flexible pipes used by oil companies in deep water, after its two previous lower offers were rejected. Wood Group, a maker of chokes, valves, pumps and wellhead systems used by companies such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell, said it had agreed to acquire PSN, a Scottish rival, for $955m. The combined "brownfield" companies – which specialise in squeezing oil out of ageing oil and gas fields – will be called Wood Group PSN. These deals indicate a confidence that the demand for oil – and therefore its price – will remain high for the foreseeable future because both companies are concerned with reaching some of the world's less accessible reserves, whether under deep sea or in heavily used wells. The value of mergers and acquisitions completed in the UK this year is on course to be the lowest since 1997, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters. Some $212.5bn worth of deals involving at least one British company had been finalised today, down from $246.1bn in 2009 and less than a quarter of the record $961bn in 2000. The $21.4bn takeover of confectioner Cadbury by Kraft, the US food company, in April was the biggest UK deal completed this year. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite trade union, reiterated his call for the scrutiny of any takeover of a UK company by a foreign business, after it emerged this month that Kraft plans to move parts of Cadbury to Switzerland for tax purposes less than a year after its controversial acquisition of the chocolate maker. "When companies like Kraft start relocating Cadbury's financial affairs to Switzerland, so that they can avoid paying the tax due for the manufacturing and selling in this country, it is difficult to retain any belief that UK plc benefits at all from how the industrial world operates," McCluskey said.

Stock markets braced for Chinese interest rate rise   China is widely expected to raise its interest rates in the wake of stronger than expected inflation figures released over the weekend. The prospects of such a move could unsettle stock markets, with commodity companies in particular likely to suffer if the country acts to dampen down demand. Inflation jumped from 4.4% in October to a 28-month high of 5.1% in November, compared to forecasts of 4.7%. The increase was driven by an 11.7% jump in food prices. Before the figures were released, China had already acted to tighten monetary policy by increasing the reserve requirements for its banks. This was prompted by stronger than expected trade data released on Friday, which showed Chinese exports rising by 34.9% in November, while imports climbed by 37.7%. But the strong inflation numbers suggested more action was required, said economists. Others suggested the November figure could represent a peak. State radio today reported comments from an annual economic conference confirming a shift from a "loose" monetary policy stance to a "prudent" one, which seemingly paves the way for a rate rise. "The priority is to actively and properly handle the relations between maintaining steady and relatively fast economic growth, economic restructuring and managing inflation expectations," said a statement from the conference. "Strategic economic restructuring will be accelerated and stabilising price levels will be given a more prominent position." Analysts said the high level of Chinese inflation could lead to higher prices in the UK for goods produced in the country.

Regional airline Flybe raised £66m from stock market flotation Flybe crowned a turbulent decade that saw it survive the aftermath of 9/11 to become one of Europe's fastest growing regional airlines by raising £66m in a stockmarket flotation. The Exeter-based airline was known as British European when it was heading for serious difficulties in 2002 but it gained a new lease of life by rebranding as Flybe and embracing a low-cost business model under chief executive Jim French. The airline operates from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton and Norwich to nearly 80 destinations in continental Europe and has aggressive expansion plans, having signed a deal this year with Brazil's Embraer to add up to 140 aircraft to its 68-strong fleet. Flybe said half the proceeds from the flotation would be used to fund aircraft deals, with the rest bolstering its cash balance that will not be deployed on a brace of acquisitions - contrary to recent speculation. It is understood that the airline is looking to expand via codeshare deals, which allow it to sell tickets on services operated by other airlines, following deals with Air France and Finnair. French said he was "very pleased" that the share offer was two-times oversubscribed, valuing the business at £215m after it launched at 295p a share. After a day of trading on the grey market, before formal trading begins on Wednesday, the shares closed up 16% at 341.25p. "We have long seen a listing as an essential step in the growth and development of the business," said French. British Airways was the only leading shareholder not to dilute its stake in the offering as it acquired more shares to keep its holding at 15%. BA became an investor after Flybe took over its regional business, BA Connect, in 2007.

Asian boom fuels record year for floats The amount raised in stockmarket flotations around the world this year is expected to break the 2007 record of $300bn (£190bn), according to research from accountants Ernst & Young. Asian companies are behind a surge in the number of floats. Britain and Europe have done better than last year, but account for only a tiny proportion of new activity because of fears about the future of the euro and the sovereign debt crisis. In the UK, the change of government, uncertainty over budget cuts and fears of a double dip recession have put off scores of companies from listing on the London Stock Exchange. E&Y says that in the first 11 months of this year, 1,199 companies have raised $255bn ($94.6bn, 2009) with Chinese firms accounting for more than 45% of the value. David Wilkinson, UK IPO leader at E&Y said: "The IPO market reflects the twin-track global economy with Europe and the US trailing Asia, where GDP is racing ahead. I think next year will be a similar story, with perhaps more action from Latin America, especially Brazil. South America has recovered less quickly from the recession than China and India, but is now rebounding strongly." Wilkinson said: "I am afraid it hasn't been a great year for the UK; shares in only four or five newly floated UK companies are today trading above the price at which they sold their shares to the public, so it's quite a sorry affair. We expected a much brighter picture back in January." He was reluctant to make predictions for the British IPO market in 2011, beyond saying there is "a pipeline of companies waiting to list their shares, but if investors demand knockdown prices, firms may conclude now is not the time to sell." E&Y says in the emerging markets, there is still everything to play for with a large number of firms earmarked for privatisation in 2011 and 2012, particularly financial institutions, commodities groups and industrial firms.

FTSE 100 index has gained 1,000 points since the start of July In the land of housing and building materials, there are also more cheerful noises after the catastrophes of the past two years. Wolseley sees signs of growth in some parts of the US. In the UK, housebuilder Bellway said it expects first-half profits to rise 20%, a figure that provoked a bounce in share prices across the sector.

FSA bans stockbroker over share-ramping   A seven year investigation by the Financial Services Authority into a share ramping scheme is drawing to a close after Graham Betton, one of the brokers involved, was today banned from the City after a 40 year career. Eagle, who was handed a record fine of £2.8m in May for his part, had wanted to use FEI as an investment vehicle and bought 85% of the company but wanted to sell all but 10% of the stock. To create a market in the shares, he bought the stockbroker SP Bell which sold FEI stock to its clients, generating demand and pushing its price up. Betton instructed SP Bell staff to sell FEI shares to clients. He is the last individual in the affair to be punished. SP Bell has received a public censure and would have been fined had it not gone into liquidation. The tribunal said Betton had personally rolled over 75 trades from client to client – consisting of at least 340m FEI shares – allowing them to defer payment for the shares indefinitely. Trading in FEI shares was suspended in July 2004, leaving more than £9m of unsettled trades which neither SP Bell nor its clients could meet. SP Bell ceased trading and went into administration. Margaret Cole, FSA managing director of enforcement and financial crime, said: "This marks the final chapter of a scheme which saw the share price of Fundamental-E Investments deliberately manipulated to the detriment of ordinary investors." Betton, who earned a salary of £75,000 and was not on commission told the Tribunal that he did not know that the purpose of the scheme was to raise FEI's share price artificially and said he had only made a profit of £4,500. In his witness statement he has admitted that his "response to the unfolding situation was tempered by the fear of being sacked by Mr Eagle". "Betton was an experienced director of an FSA authorised firm. He knew that the trading for his clients was artificial and he worked closely with Winterflood and its traders to artificially raise the price of the stock. This betrayed his duty to his clients and as the Tribunal has agreed was damaging to market confidence," Cole said.

Commodities trader Glencore poised for £30bn flotation Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader, plans a flotation next year, although the company has yet to pick London for the listing, the Guardian has learned. Glencore, which could be valued at as much as £30bn, is eyeing stock markets in Asia as an alternative to the London Stock Exchange, as investors favour the booming economies of China and India over moribund western markets. The company declined to comment but City chatter suggests a float may be on the cards. A partial flotation of the business, owned by more than 400 partners, would be aimed at raising cash for acquisitions. The Switzerland-based trader owns one third of UK miner Xstrata, raising speculation that a full bid for the business could be considered. Glencore's revenues have boomed over the past year as commodities such as gold or copper have rocketed, fuelled by strong demand from emerging markets. Investors have also flocked to metals such as gold, avoiding the volatile equity and credit markets in Europe and the US. The company has issued up to $2.2bn (£1.4bn) in convertible bonds to investors in the US, Singapore and China. Revenues soared to $70bn in the first half, from $45bn last year, according to the company's latest accounts. Net profit rose to $1.5bn, from $1.0bn in 2009. The company was able to "take advantage of the gradual recovery in the global economy and generally higher average commodity prices," it said this summer. Founded in 1974 by US trader Marc Rich, Glencore also owns and develops mining projects around the world, including oil exploration and development blocks in West Africa and a Gold mining operation in Kazakhstan. In 1983, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, then a US prosecutor, indicted Rich for tax evasion who sought refuge in Switzerland. Rich was pardoned by president Bill Clinton in 2001. Initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions are returning to the markets after two years of drought, caused by the global credit crunch. The last quarter of this year is on track to become the highest quarter on record for global public flotations (IPOs), according to Dealogic. At present, global IPO volumes stand at $99bn, via 289 deals, Dealogic said. Asia Pacific accounts for 60% of IPOs in the fourth quarter, including offerings from AIA Group or Petronas Chemicals. Morgan Stanley led the November global IPO manager ranking, with deals worth $5.4bn, followed by Goldman Sachs, which led 10 transactions worth $4.2bn, Dealogic reports.

Promethean World sees shares slump after profits warning Education technology firm Promethean World has cemented its reputation as the worst flotation of 2010 after hitting its shareholders with a profits warning. Promethean World, which makes interactive whiteboards and handheld learner-response systems for students, admitted today that sales have fallen sharply in recent weeks in the face of austerity cutbacks in America and across Europe. With sales in the current quarter now lower than a year ago, the company is on track to miss its revenue targets for this year. Blackburn-based Promethean World blamed "a deepening of budgetary uncertainties and constraints" since the end of October, adding that it is hopeful that potential orders have simply been delayed rather than cancelled. But shares in the company crashed by a third, to 52p. They have now lost nearly three-quarters of their value since the company was floated at 200p per share in March. Analysts were scathing about the profits warning. Numis Securities slashed its forecast for 2011 by 50%, pointing out that the company had hoped that Europe would be a growth market. "Given the issues over scale and rapidity of downgrade, substantial slowdown in the largest market, lack of momentum in the 'new' markets of Europe, we expect investors to be wary and believe it will be a Herculean task for the company to rebuild credibility," Numis said. Despite the recent slowdown, Promethean World is still on track to increase revenues by 20% this year. Numis, however, estimates sales are currently declining at "significant double-digit rates". The slump in the company's value, from £400m in March to just £105m today, will have hurt founder Tony Cann in the pocket as he still has a 40% stake in the business. Apax Partners, the private equity firm, sold its stake during the flotation, which was handled by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Cazenove and Gleacher Shacklock. These three banks received most of the £8.5m fees paid during the float.

Shares fall on fears over North Korean attack and Irish bailout Traders said the artillery shelling off the island of Yeonpyeong earlier today, in which two soldiers were killed, had heightened tensions. The South Korean won fell heavily, dropping by 3.5% against the dollar, and the cost of insuring South Korea's government debt jumped by a fifth. "It is bad news all round this morning... as concerns over the Irish economy and the situation between North and South Korea continue to mount,"said Yusuf Heusen, senior sales trader at IG Index. "The uncertainty surrounding the stability of the Irish government has raised fears that the EU bailout could be delayed for some time to come." The London stock market saw a burst of selling, with the FTSE 100 index dropping 66 points, or 1.2%, to 5613. Mining stocks led the fallers, along with Lloyds Banking Group – one of the UK banks most exposed to Ireland's financial sector – which dropped nearly 3% to 62p at one stage. Spread-betters had expected European stock markets to show small losses this morning, before the exchange of fire between North and South Korea. Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income research at Evolution Securities, warned that many investors are now expecting the weaker members of the eurozone to restructure their debt. "This latest bout of the crisis gained momentum with the many comments regarding bond holders 'sharing the pain'. When it was clear that these statements were doing damage to the market and undermining confidence various G20 finance ministers published a statement to try and reassure the market that existing debt would not be affected. However it is clear from bond prices that the market does not consider this to be a realistic assessment of the situation. There is just too much outstanding debt," Jenkins said. But Spain's five-year CDS rose by 4.5 basis points to 286.5bp, with the Portugese CDS contract rising 10.5bp to 468bp. The difference between the interest rate on Spanish 10-year government debt and its German equivalent also rose today to its highest level since the euro was created - 233 basis points. This followed an auction of Spanish debt in which the country offered higher interest rates to buyers than previously. The dollar, a traditional "safe-haven" in turbulent times, rose against other major currencies following the Korean attacks. The euro fell against the dollar, falling more than one cent to $1.3495, from $1.3618.

UK clearing house LCH.Clearnet spurns £400m US bid Europe's largest independent clearing house, London-based LCH.Clearnet, has rebuffed a £400m bid for the company from InterContinental Exchange (ICE). The offer by ICE, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was backed by the Singapore stock exchange and highlights how clearing has become a major new sector for mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the financial crisis. Regulators are drawing up rules that will force almost all derivatives transactions to go through registered exchanges and be processed by clearing houses. The moves are designed to boost transparency in the derivatives market and improve risk management for deals that have traditionally been done over-the-counter (OTC): in other words, in private via brokerages or "bilaterally" between individual institutions. Clearing houses act as central counterparties, ensuring that players get their money back if one participant involved in a deal goes bust. Clearers require clients to furnish collateral or "margin" to provide a financial cushion for the clearing house so that it can repay debts that turn sour. LCH.Clearnet is controlled by more than 90 shareholders who are also its users – mostly banks and trading organisations such as the London Metals Exchange. The organisation is believed to have rejected ICE's bid on the grounds that it did not reflect the true value of the clearer. ICE's offer also ran into opposition from LCH.Clearnet's shareholders who feared a takeover could result in higher trading fees from fewer players in the market. "A higher offer could have brought them round to the negotiating table," said one stakeholder. Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, refused to comment on "bid speculation" but admitted the upshot of initiatives to put trading in financial instruments such as credit default swaps through registered exchanges and clearing houses would be "extreme". He said: "Just look at the interest rate swap market, where trades today are worth a notional value of $350tn [£219tn] but only $115tn go through LCH, the rest are traded over-the-counter." Liddell said the expanding market will increase competition but bring fees down in the long term as consolidation follows "proliferation". ICE serves global markets for agricultural, credit, currency, emissions and energy markets. It also operates three futures exchanges, including the London-based ICE Futures Europe, which hosts daily trading in half of the world's crude and refined oil futures contracts. Two years ago, ICE began to build its clearing house operation in London, but observers believe the Americans want to acquire LCH.Clearnet because building their business organically was too slow a process. The Singaporeans are keen to expand in London and view ICE as a potential ally. Paul Swann, of ICE Clear Europe, said: "We are likely to see more asset classes go through clearing houses following initiatives announced at the G20 meeting in London last year and the passing of new laws in Washington." Analysts say LCH is under pressure as the London Stock Exchange has indicated it plans to set up its own clearing house for cash equities, making it more important than ever that LCH expands into areas that were previously dominated by over-the-counter businesses.

Quantitative easing boost keeps world stock markets buoyant Stock markets rallied for a second day this morning and gold hit a new record in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to inject more money into the US economy. Copper and oil also strengthened, with both hitting two-year highs as the weak dollar continued to drive the boom in commodities. Traders cautioned that the optimism could be short-lived, though. "Quite how long the gains can be sustained remains to be seen and the risk of some opportunistic profit-taking ahead of the weekend break shouldn't be overlooked either, but Asia seems to have avoided this reversion and for the time being it's simply a case of buying across the board," said Ben Potter, market strategist at IG Markets. The dollar steadied somewhat this morning after touching an 11-month low against a basket of currencies yesterday. US non-farm payrolls data today is expected to show that 60,000 new jobs were created in October across America, although it is unlikely to be enough to bring the near-10% jobless rate down. "With the firing of census workers having ended and private demand for workers rising, payrolls should post their first increase since May, but it won't be enough to get the unemployment rate down quickly," said James Knightley at ING. David Buik at BGC Partners said: "There is no quick solution to this issue. In the 60s, 70s and 80s recessions, which were unemployment driven, it took about eight months to redress the trend. Between 2000 and 2004 it took two to three years. This recession is the deepest for 80 years. It has been going 17 months and the end is not in sight. 65,000 jobs may have been created in October, but to see some light at the end of the tunnel we need to see 100,000 to 150,000 jobs being created."

World stock markets rally on Fed move In London the FTSE 100 hit its highest level in nearly 29 months, with other European markets also showing strong gains. US stocks also rallied, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 1% when Wall Street opened. Last night the Fed announced a second round of QE in which it will inject $600bn (£370bn) – $75bn a month – into the economy through asset purchases by the end of June next year in an attempt to revive the flagging recovery. Most analysts had expected the Fed to pump in $500bn. "It seems that in the very short term, the market has received QE2 well, but with jobless data round the corner and the health of the recovery now under even closer scrutiny, any real vindication of the policy could take months to emerge," said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, director of private client research at Charles Stanley, said the Fed was unlikely to be able to launch a third bout of QE next year. "The final months of the QE2 programme are likely to be dominated by talk along the lines of 'will the Fed do a QE3?' The newly appointed Congress is going to say 'no'," he said. When the reinvestment of maturing debt held by the Fed is added in, monthly Treasury purchases will be around $110bn, according to a statement issued by the New York Fed yesterday. Thus the total programme amounts to $850bn- $900bn. The Dow Jones closed up 26.41 points at 11,215.13 last night, its highest level for two years. Today it gained another 124 points in early trading to 11,339. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei index jumped 198.80 points today, or 2.2%, to 9358.78. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.7% to 24535.63 while China's Shanghai composite index rose 1.9% to 3086.94. Oil jumped to a six-month high this morning – US crude for December rose $1.07 to $85.76 a barrel. Some economists think that the dollar could fall further and continue to push up prices for commodities priced in dollars.

Turquoise trading shutdown may have been sabotage, LSE says The Financial Services Authority has been informed of the exchange's suspicions and it is understood that the police have also been called in to investigate a shutdown which began at 8.23am today. The LSE's Turquoise trading platform – used by hedge funds and high-frequency professional traders – remained shut until 10.30am, prompting a major internal investigation. By tonight, the LSE admitted the problem may have been caused deliberately. A spokeswoman said: "Preliminary investigations indicate that this human error may have occurred in suspicious circumstances. The LSE takes this matter very seriously and a full internal investigation has now begun. The relevant authorities have been informed." The problems at Turquoise, known in the City as a "dark pool" which allows participants to trade anonymously with each another, had major repercussions for the LSE which had been planning to transfer its entire share trading business, known as the main market, to a new system today. The LSE had been under pressure from its customers to delay the introduction of the new computer system to allow further network upgrades even before the latest problems but has now been forced to abandon any updates until next year. "The LSE will work in partnership with customers to agree a date as early and practicably as possible in 2011 to reschedule the main market migration," the exchange said. The systems delays will be an embarrassment to the LSE's chief executive Xavier Rolet who bought the Sri Lankan company MillenniumIT last year to allow the exchange to overhaul its current technology systems so it can compete with the alternative trading platforms which have been springing up and posing a threat to the LSE. The explosion of rival trading platforms has meant that trading in the biggest stocks in London has been drifting away from the LSE, which is now accounts of around 60% of trading in shares in FTSE 100 companies. By moving to the technology provided by MillenniumIT, the LSE was hoping to be able to offer the fastest trading platform in the world. The transfer of Turquoise onto the new technology last month had already caused problems for the exchange, after it suffered glitches on its first day.

Stock markets move higher ahead of Federal Reserve announcement Stock markets moved sharply higher today in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will tomorrow night announce plans to pump more money into the flagging US economy. Analysts are expecting Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to push ahead with up to $1tn of quantitative easing (QE) to help spur growth and cut unemployment. Other central bank policymakers meeting this week, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank on Thursday, will pay close attention. The chances of further QE from the UK authorities increased today after new figures showed that Britain's construction sector grew more slowly than expected in October – suggesting it is unlikely to make as big a contribution to GDP in the final quarter as it did earlier in the year. The latest construction purchasing managers index fell to 51.6 from 53.8 in September – its lowest for eight months – and below forecasts. This still indicates growth, but at a slowing pace. Activity in the housing and civil engineering sectors is falling but commercial construction grew strongly. New orders continued to rise, albeit at the slowest rate since February. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index, said: "Considering how prominent growth in construction played in the recent better-than-expected first reading of UK growth in the third quarter, this could be seen as a bit of a warning sign towards how GDP could fare in the fourth quarter." The FTSE 100 finished 62.81 points higher at 5757.43, close to a new six-month high, with Wall Street ahead more than 70 points by the time London closed. US shares were also lifted by the expectation of strong Republican gains in the US mid-term elections. Meanwhile, the expectation of further QE by the Fed sent the dollar sharply lower, which in turn boosted commodity prices. Oil rose more than 1% to more than $84 a barrel, while copper climbed from $8,300 a tonne to $8,418. This week's strong Chinese manufacturing figures are also supporting base metal prices. The Australian dollar again passed parity with its US counterpart after the central bank in Sydney unexpectedly raised interest rates. Ilya Spivak, currency analyst at Daily FX, said: "Should [the Fed's QE programme] materialize, the spotlight will fall on the tone of the accompanying policy statement as traders comb it for clues on where the Fed plans to move going forward. "On balance, a relatively dovish outcome is likely to boost risk appetite to drive shares, key commodities and the pound against the dollar higher. Any signs of reluctance about renewed QE or a smaller amount in asset purchases would likely have the opposite effect."

Warren Buffett sparks succession talk with new hire Warren Buffett has sparked fresh speculation over his succession by hiring a 39-year-old investment manager to run a significant part of his empire. Todd Combs, until now the relatively little-known chief executive of Castle Point Capital, is joining the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate in a move that puts him among the frontrunners to replace Buffett. The "Sage of Omaha", who celebrated his 80th birthday at the end of August, said Combs's appointment followed a long search conducted by himself and his partner Charlie Munger. Analysts said it was unusual for Berkshire Hathaway to make such a public statement about a new appointment. Combs has run Castle Point for the past five years. The fund focuses on financial stocks, and appears to have weathered the recent crisis relatively well. According to Reuters, the company achieved a 14% return on investment in 2006, and 17% in 2007. It lost 5.7% during the turbulence of 2008, but gained 6.2% last year. Like Buffett, Combs writes an annual letter to his shareholders. In July he wrote: "We may begin with the acknowledgment of the pervasive reality of failure – that, for instance, 99.9% of biological species that have ever existed are now extinct... Or, a little close to home, that only one original member of the Dow Jones industrial index continues to be a member today." Buffett, whose net worth was estimated this year at $47bn (£30bn), has previously indicated that his work would be divided among several people when he finally left Berkshire Hathaway. This would see a new chief executive appointed, plus at least one other person handling the investment decisions. Buffett has not given any indication that he is planning to retire, and has often appeared reluctant to relinquish the reins at Berkshire Hathaway. He told shareholders in 2007: "I've reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term 'thinking outside the box'."
