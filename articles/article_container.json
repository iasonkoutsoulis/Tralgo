Panmure Gordon described the move as a \"sad end for investors\" and suggested the bid was a low ball one.

The deal appears to have come crashing down, however, after questions were raised about how Global Gaming - which made around \u00a3500,000 last year - intended to pay for the acquisition. Following an investigation by Stockholm-based AktieTorget - the equity market on which GGF trades its shares - officials announced yesterday that the company would be permanently barring from doing business on the exchange. The statement said that Global Gaming had \"seriously violated\" the exchange's rules by failing to ensure that information it provided to investors was \"accurate, relevant and reliable\". \"They give a systematic impression of a lack of accountability and of an almost casual and unsuspecting approach to disclosure requirements.\" Concerns about GGF's actions had spread almost as soon as the company announced its plans earlier this year, and Gunther Marder, head of the Swedish Shareholders' Assocation, said \"everything seemed shady from the start\". \"It is impossible to say what has been true and what has been a lie,\" he told the Associated Press. \"This entire affair has been lined with clumsy statements and doubtful claims.\" Last week AktieTorget had suspended GGF's shares, with senior officials suggesting that the company had failed to produce any evidence that it had the funds, or agreements with investors to provide the required cash.", "Market rally is not over yet, says Morgan Stanley After August's stock market rally and last week's subsequent dip, investors have been concerned that shares may have run ahead of themselves and lost touch with economic reality. Draaisma and his team have not turned into all-out bulls, but they are positive about the immediate future, although they admit there are concerns: \"There are plenty of things to worry about. Near-term, investors are worried that the rally has gone too far too fast. They worry that there are some important signs of deteriorating conditions, such as lower bond yields, higher VIX [volatility index], the 44% fall in the Baltic Dry Index, the 23% fall in the Chinese stock market, the first global rate hike (Israel on 24 August), the nearing end to quantitative easing, and the end of the cash-for-clunkers programme. \"Medium-term, investors are worried about the poor state of government finances, deleveraging of households and the financial sector. We very much share these medium-term concerns, but we are less worried about the next 3-6 months. \"Economic news has been impressive, recently. US housing data show signs of stabilization, with inventories of unsold homes having fallen to about 8 months. Manufacturing surveys have risen further. Importantly, central bankers tell us that they do not intend to hike rates anytime soon, and Ben Bernanke has been reappointed for another term, ensuring continuity. We would start to get more nervous about equity market direction if and when policymakers feel confident enough to embark on fiscal or monetary tightening, but that is not the case yet. \"On a 3-6 month view, we continue to have a positive bias on equities, and prefer equities over government bonds, as we have done ever since we became more optimistic in July. We think the rebound rally has further to go, still.\" And after that? \"We think the next market phase will be a correction, coinciding with the start of monetary or fiscal tightening. At some point an upside growth surprise will lead to fiscal or monetary tightening, which in turn will lead to dislocation. Our analysis of historical secular bear markets is consistent with this. \"The challenge will be to identify what constitutes the start of tightening. It could be a variety of things, including: an oil price spike, an inflation spike, a tax hike (such as the VAT rate hike in Japan in 1997), a more stringent capital requirement for banks (such as what happened in the US in 1936), or simply the first Fed rate hike (which is most often the signal).\"", "RSA drops on cash call talk, as FTSE rally fades The insurer fell 6.2p to 124.4p, a near 5% decline, as investors took fright at the prospect of a reported \u00a3600m rights issue, supposedly to boost its balance sheet and give it firepower for acquisitions. Traders said they would be surprised at such a move unless there was a deal in the offing, since RSA recently raised its dividend and bought back some of its debt. \"It's been a see-saw sort of session as many traders returned to their trading screens and tried to make sense of the substantial rally many of them may have missed in the last couple of months. That said, volumes remained light and may well do so into next week as the UK's bank holiday yesterday is followed by a US holiday next Monday. \"The overriding concern of this recent rally has been its lack of volume and today may have marked the first round of sustained profit taking. In the back of many investors' minds is the concern that September is usually a poor month for equities and we haven't got the month off to the best of starts.

Well, the market isn't keen on cash calls, so Standard suffered from that, but the broader context is the bulls of bank shares are betting that now is the time to start anticipating economic recovery. Their arguments, simply put, are these: first, the government has stabilised the sector; second, bank shares suffered most in the downturn so should be among the biggest beneficiaries when the economy picks up; third, we are two years into the crisis and the tide is beginning to turn. It's all a bit previous. As I keep saying, it's only a matter of months since Royal Bank of Scotland's ability to keep its branches and cash machines open hung by a gossamer thread. If Barclays had not carried on doing business with it, the fallen Edinburgh giant would not have been able to do so. Indeed, RBS, which just scraped into profit with \u00a37.5bn of bad debts, sounded a much more cautious note than Lloyds, warning that its operating performance might not improve for a couple of years. It could be even worse. The Eighties slump was concentrated in traditional heavy industry; this one is across the board. Debt - consumer, corporate and government - is running at very high levels; there will have to be some serious deleveraging. The low interest rate environment is making the debt burden easier to bear, but there are problems ahead when interest rates rise again, possibly a year or 18 months from now. Banks face hefty bad loan write-offs for some time to come. Even leaving that aside, they cannot pat themselves on the back about a recovery before they have restored lending at sensible levels to small and medium sized firms. The small business sector is a major employer and restoring confidence there is a key element in any revival. The banks' fortunes are obviously harnessed to the economy as a whole. There, the signals are contradictory, not least because of the fragmentation of Britain's crunch economy. Those still in receipt of a salary or pension and without burdensome borrowings are in many cases better off due to lower interest rates and cheaper prices. That contrasts sharply with those in negative equity, heavy debt or who have lost their job. And, despite a flurry of headlines last week hailing the end of the recession, Bank of England governor Mervyn King feels it is too early to breathe sighs of relief, pumping a further \u00a350bn into the economy through quantitative easing. This discussion is trickier because the definition of recovery is to some degree subjective. If it assumes a return to pre-crisis conditions, that is nowhere in prospect. If it is taken to mean the very worst is over, the recovery probably has begun. But half the banks are still on life support and the economy is still receiving transfusions of cash. It's going to be a long convalescence - and we can't rule out a relapse."], "2009-7-B2": ["Wall Street's slide fails to dent FTSE An opening slide on Wall Street has failed to curb enthusiasm in London, despite increasing jitters in Asia that the Chinese stock market is heading into bubble territory. US economic data showing that orders for durable goods, excluding cars and planes, rose 1.1% in June, a better performance that the number-crunchers had been expecting, helped Wall Street reverse an opening slide. An hour after the opening the Dow Jones is down about 25.24 points at 9071.40 with the FTSE 100 index up 38.08 points at 4566.92 points. Both indices seem to have shrugged aside increasing worries in Asia that a stockmarket bubble is forming in China, as evidenced by the spectacular arrival of China State Construction Engineering Corp on the Shanghai exchange overnight. Shares in China's largest IPO since Petro China in 2007 rose more than 50% on their debut. It is the country's biggest housebuilder and has benefitted from the government's policy of encouraging a boom in infrastructure investment by leaning on the country's banks to increase lending. Economists are worried about where this money is going - some of it seems to be finding its way into speculative investments - and its ultimately destabilising effect on the Chinese economy and hence the rest of the world. As a result of the jitters, indices across Asia closed lower overnight. Announcing a 20% drop in first half profits and plans to axe its interim dividend, Rexam explained: The Rights Issue will enable the Group to put in place a more conservative and resilient long term capital structure and significantly enhances the prospect of maintaining the Group's current investment grade credit rating. The issue will also put Rexam in a strong position from which to grow when markets recover. Since the Interim Management Statement in May it has become increasingly clear that the effect of the recession on Rexam's trading will be deeper and more prolonged than previously thought with cyclical, more premium parts of the business disproportionately impacted by the downturn. Destocking has given way to reduced underlying customer demand reducing the Group's ability to generate cash and pay down debt. The company wants to get its \u00a32.1bn of debt under control. It has \u00a33.2bn worth of loans and overdrafts and refinanced \u00a31.3bn in the half year. It has already managed to secure another \u00a3453m of \"bilateral facilities\" to underpin its access to liquidity and renegotiated a substantial portion of its \u00a3775m revolving credit facility as well as several facilities which were due to mature in 2010. The cost of all this debt, however, has gone up. The group's next major round of refinancing will be in relation to the \u00a3495m committed bank facilities due in 2011, followed by a further \u00a3904m of bank facilities due in 2012 with \u00a31.062bn, comprising the \u20ac700m bond, the US bond and US private placement, due in 2013.

Does Reckitt have a 'silver bullet'? We think not. Generic competition we feel sure is both inevitable and likely to be pretty much immediate. We see little that Reckitt can do to offset this - its slow-release technology won't get clearance for three to four years, while brands count for very little (virtually nothing) in this field. [Reckitt's] 2009 results may be impacted by the exact date that generics go live (a one week delay worth \u00a35m to earnings), but it seems inevitable that generics will be in full force by the year end.

Investors took heart from this week's bumper figures from Goldman Sachs and better than expected results from Intel, as well as reasonable US manufacturing and inflation numbers. Even another jump in UK unemployment could not dampen the positive mood, with analysts pointing out that the number of benefit claims grew by less than forecast. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: \"The FTSE has had a very positive move higher today, catching quite a few people by surprise in the process and often such moves can be compounded by a sudden rush of investors jumping on board to get in while they can and not miss out on any big move higher. \"The rally has been broad based with all sectors benefiting and on some pretty solid volumes too. The rate of unemployment in the UK may have risen higher than expected, making for a grim headline figure, however the rise in claimants was the smallest for a year, which investors took as further indication that the worst is over. \"The test for the FTSE will be the resistance seen around 4350-4400 and whilst today's rally is encouraging, [can] the FTSE carry on higher to take out 4500?

It is important to take a long-term view and we are focusing on those with quality growth rather than the cheapest stocks in the market.

The bank is already well capitalised and does not need the money from flotation, but HSBC is keen to raise its profile with Chinese retail investors as it expands its branch network and looks at buying stakes in rival Chinese banks. HSBC confirmed that it was planning to list in Shanghai, but declined to discuss details and timing. Mike Trippitt, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said: \"It will be easier for HSBC to grow its operations in China if people there have a financial stake in the brand. This is all about HSBC raising its profile in a market that is crucial to its success.\" HSBC recently signalled its determination to expand in China and across Asia by moving Michael Geoghegan, its chief executive, from London to be based full-time in Hong Kong, where HSBC is already quoted. The bank was founded in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 1865, but shifted its headquarters to London in 1993 after acquiring the Midland Bank. Hong Kong and China accounted for 40% of HSBC's pretax profits last year and analysts predict this could reach 50% over the next decade. A disastrous foray into the US sub-prime market, where it has been forced to write off billions because of the credit crunch, has persuaded management to return to its roots in the Far East, say analysts. Beijing has let it be known that it is ready to start allowing foreign companies to list on the Chinese mainland, reflecting its ambitions to open up the country's financial sector and transform Shanghai into an international financial hub to rival London and New York. Lawyers in London say that the China Securities Regulatory Commission is expected to change its laws in January to allow foreign and non-mainland companies to list in Shanghai. But the Chinese will retain a cap of 20% on the proportion of equity foreign banks can acquire in Chinese financial companies. Simon Maughan, an analyst at MF Global, said: \"You can't overestimate the importance of China. If the Chinese were to move towards more open capital markets, perhaps allowing foreign institutions to invest in Chinese government debt, HSBC would be better positioned than any other western bank because it already has such a big presence in Hong Kong. A listing in Shanghai would reinforce its position in the region.\" HSBC is already the biggest foreign bank in a country where the market potential is viewed as vast. \"Currying favour with the Chinese is both sensible and necessary if you are serious about growing in a nation with 1.3 billion people,\" said Maughan.

Dubai World, a partly state-owned conglomerate, has been at the heart of the extraordinary growth surge in Dubai over recent years which has dramatically changed the physical landscape and is behind the palm-shaped islands that are being developed for luxury homes and hotels. The company is also involved in projects around the world, including Gulf banks, ports in 50 countries and a six-tower hotel-entertainment complex in Las Vegas. Dubai World requested a payment standstill on 25 November for $3.52bn worth of Islamic bonds maturing this month as it tried to restructure $26bn worth of debt. EFG Hermes, a regional investment bank, thinks Dubai in total could owe as much as $150bn \u2013 twice the size of the economy and two\u2013and\u2013a-half times its officially declared debt. The debt standstill statement took the financial markets by surprise because many investors had expected the Dubai government \u2013 or the nearby Abu Dhabi one \u2013 would step in and bail out such a key Middle East investment vehicle rather than see it publicly flounder. The default also played into wider fears that global stock markets had risen to unsustainable levels and company values did not reflect the continuing fragility of the world economy. The large exposure to the debt crisis of banks such as RBS are a major embarrassment at a time when they are trying to rebuild public confidence following their own government bailouts. Rescuing the British banking system is estimated by the National Audit Office to have cost the equivalent of more than \u00a35,500 for every family in the country but RBS directors are threatening to resign if they cannot approve a \u00a31.5bn bonus bonanza to their own staff.", "New Look hires City veteran as chairman ahead of flotation The move comes just a day after New Look announced it had appointed three investment banks to mastermind its flotation, which is expected early in the new year. New Look, which has more than 1,000 stores in 30 countries and employs 25,000 staff, is currently owned by private equity groups Permira and Apax Partners, and the chain's founder, Tom Singh. They bought the business off the stock exchange five years ago for \u00a3800m and have already recouped their original investment by piling debt, currently totalling \u00a31bn, into the business. The latest flotation will be the second time in two years that the owners have tried to cash in their chips. A first attempt, with a sale to other private equity groups, failed when no one was prepared to pay the \u00a31.8bn asking price. This time they are more hopeful of achieving that target. The chain has performed well through the recession. Gildersleeve joined Tesco in 1965 and was a director for 20 years until 2004. He is currently chairman of Carphone Warehouse and a director at British Land. He has also held boardroom positions at EMI, Gallaher, Lloyds TSB and Vodafone. New Look's chief executive, Carl McPhail, said the change of chairman was part of \"a planned transition in the next phase of New Look's development\" and that Wrigley would remain \"a close friend of New Look\". On Wednesday, New Look appointed JP Morgan Cazenove, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse as advisers, although a decision on the precise timing of the float is not expected until after the key Christmas trading period is over. New Look is among a number of groups preparing to float next year. Others include Merlin, the leisure group behind Alton Towers and Warwick Castle, retailer Pets at Home and the Superdry fashion chain. The first to go will provide a crucial litmus test of investors' enthusiasm."], "2009-11-B2": ["Dubai shares plummet as crisis continues Today, many investors in the Middle East will get their first opportunity to respond to the crisis - as trading has been suspended since the middle of last week for the Eid al-Adha holiday. These debts include Nakheel's $3.5bn (\u00a32.1bn) sukuk bond which was due for repayment on December 14. The crisis began last week when Nakheel sought a six-month delay on paying this off. The sell-off has gathered a bit of pace since trading began - with the main Abu Dhabi index now down 8.24% at 2670, a drop of 239 points. It is not allowed to fall by more than 10% in one day, so regulators could step in and halt trading if the slide continues. The National Bank of Abu Dhabi is down 9.7%. In Dubai, its main share index is 7.19% lower at 1942 points. These falls come despite efforts by business leaders to calm the situation. Riad Kamal, chief executive of construction firm Arabtec, has said he is confident that Dubai will not default on its debts. \"Dubai should be given time to restructure its debt. I'm not going to lose sleep over this issue,\" Kamal told Reuters. We are continuing to monitor the situation following the unexpected announcement by the government of Dubai regarding a standstill on the debt of Dubai World and its Nakheel subsidiary, which has had an adverse impact on financial markets. The IMF's statement underlines how much pressure is on the UAE to rescue Dubai. Yesterday's launch of the special liquidity scheme could help.... The Japanese prime minister has also just been talking about the situation - telling reporters in Tokyo that he \"remains cautious over Dubai credit worries\". Another sign that the world market are feeling more optimistic is that the US dollar has lost ground against many other currencies, which has helped to push the oil price up. Despite the state of the US economy, investors still seek the safety of the greenback at times of crisis. Over in the UAE, the main Abu Dhabi share index has not clawed back any ground - it is currently 8.3% lower. According to the Daily Telegraph, a Dubai government spokesman has said that the game will 'date quickly' ... The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (its main market), has tumbled 8.3% - its biggest one-day fall ever. It lost 241.92 points to 2668.23. In Dubai, its main index fell by 7.3% - which is its biggest fall since 8th October 2008 when the banking crisis was at its height. Dubai World ended down nearly 15%. With the FTSE 100 now down by 50 points at 5195, there is growing concern that we have not heard more from the Abu Dhabi central bank about its rescue plan ... He is one of the best things to have happened to British racing since the invention of the horseshoe. But there are fears in the industry that he may have to cut back, should Dubai end up defaulting on its debts. We'll let you know as soon as there are any developments. Until then, thanks for reading and for the comments. After decades of unprecedented growth and expansion Dubai's overheated economy is reaching its melting point. Dubai World, the state-owned real-estate and ports giant that has driven much of the economic growth in the city-state in recent years, has asked for a moratorium on its debt", "Gordon Brown attempts to play down global impact of Dubai crisis The prime minister said this morning that Dubai's problems were \"a setback\", during a summit meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Trinidad and Tobago. \"My own view is the world financial system is stronger now and able to deal with the problems that arise,\" said Brown. \"I think we will find it is not on the scale of previous problems we have dealt with. I think global recovery has depended on monetary action and fiscal stimulus,\" he added. Brown was speaking before shares on Wall Street fell less than feared, which helped to drive the FTSE 100 back upwards to close almost 1% higher than yesterday. Brown also said that he had spoken to senior figures in Dubai, and was confident that their plans to redevelop the ports they own in the UK would still go ahead. \"The world economy has put in place mechanisms by which when a problem starts in one country we are in a far better position to monitor it and to gauge the effects,\" Brown said in Port of Spain. The prime minister said that the major impediment to the plans for British ports were planning restrictions. Dubai World, the government-owned conglomerate that is now struggling to repay its debt, operates through its Dubai Ports World subsidiary container terminals at Tilbury, near London, and Southampton. It owns P&O, and is the third-largest port operator in the world. It has plans for regeneration projects include Chelsea Harbour, Regent Quarter at King's Cross, London Gateway Terminal and Shell Haven. Brown said: \"The problem essentially for the Dubai ports has been issues relating to planning in Britain. This is potential project for Britain that will bring a large number of jobs. It has to go through a large number of hurdles.\" Brown attempted to sound an upbeat note as he awoke in Port of Spain \u2013 after a late-night flight to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting \u2013 to the news from Dubai. \"This is a setback but I think you will find this is not on a scale where previous problems have been dealt with,\" he said. The prime minister said he did not believe the crisis in Dubai would threaten the world economic recovery. He cited the sophisticated monitoring of financial markets and the unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli over the last year. \"There is five trillions of fiscal stimulus in the world economy \u2013 either had or about to have \u2013 and that is what is bringing the economy up. The monetary easing, with low interest rates and with quantitative easing in Britain and America \u2013 these have been the most important thing in giving the world economy a boost. \"You are obviously going to have setbacks with a bank here or an organisation there that has had problems. But I believe the world has got a better way of monitoring what is happening and measuring the effects of this so that despite setbacks we can be assured we are still moving forward. \"You are dealing with one set of issues related to Dubai. Dubai is part of the UAE, it is part of a wider enterprise. We are going to have issues like this because of the fallout over the last two years. But my own view is that the world financial system is stronger now and it will be able to deal with problems as they arise.\" Brown was speaking after the London stock market shrugged off an early plunge in share prices, following efforts by the emirate's ruling family to calm the panic. After a bout of heavy selling in Asia, the mood in the City was that traders are trying to catch their breath following the shock on Wednesday when Dubai World asked to defer repaying some debts for six months. However, shares did also fall on Wall Street when trading began today, following yesterday's holiday. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum, the uncle of Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, attempted to calm the situation last night. \"Our intervention in Dubai World was carefully planned and reflects its specific financial position,\" he said in a statement. \"The government is spearheading the restructuring of this commercial operation in the full knowledge of how the markets would react. We understand the concerns of the market and the creditors in particular. However, we have had to intervene because of the need to take decisive action to address its particular debt burden.\" The FTSE 100 tumbled by 70 points, or nearly 1.4%, to 5123 when trading began. But with share prices volatile, it clawed back all these losses and closed 51.6 points higher at 5245.7, up 0.99%. There was relief that the Dow Jones fell by less than 2% when the half-day session began on Wall Street, having been closed yesterday for Thanksgiving. The index was just 1.3% lower at 10330 when trading ended in the City. Traders in London were not alarmed by a report that Britain's banks are exposed to almost $50bn of UAE debt, more than any other country. Earlier the Nikkei 225 closed 3.2% lower, with Japan's biggest banks leading the fallers. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell by 5.3%. Major building firms in Asia also fell sharply, as traders anticipated that the Dubai building boom was over. Today, Dubai itself came under more pressure. The cost of insuring the emirate's debt increased again, with five-year credit default swaps jumping by 129 basis points to 670 basis points this morning. Credit default swaps for Dubai World Ports jumped even more, from 608 basis points to 818.5. These changes indicate that the markets believe there is more chance of Dubai defaulting on its debts. And the value of an Islamic bond issued by Nakheel, Dubai World's property division, and due for repayment in December, almost halved. This is the debt which Dubai World hopes to avoid redeeming for six months. Predictions that Dubai could drag the world economy downwards again knocked $5.50 off the price of a barrel of oil, to $72.49. Many stock markets in the Middle East are closed for the feast of Eid al-Adha, making it harder to know how the region will respond to Dubai's woes. \"This certainly proves that the perceived immunity of the Gulf region from the credit crunch is a mirage and also puts doubts in investors' minds on what else they are being economical on the truth with,\" said Philip Gillett of IG Index. \"I think it is the timing that has caused less violent reaction than expected, with the US holiday and Eid, so should be interesting this afternoon,\" he added. Manus Cranny, senior market commentator at MF Global Spreads, said that some traders in London have been buying into the banking and mining shares in the search for bargains after yesterday's sell-off. \"Only time will tell whether this is bottom fishing or if it will turn into a deep-sea dive ... This bounce off the bottom in London could be a bigger mirage than the daily haze that shrouds Dubai,\" Cranny said. It also emerged this morning that, according to JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Scotland has been the biggest loan arranger for Dubai World since January 2007. Analysts at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch said this morning that the statement from the Dubai ruling family indicates that they are determined to restructure Dubai World's debt despite the impact on the financial markets. \"The restructuring is likely to make the new issuances for UAE much harder in the short term and the implicit Abu Dhabi support is no longer taken for granted. Hence, we expect a further pressure on the banking sector,\" they said.", "Biggest daily fall for FTSE since March on Dubai and LSE woes A day after reporting falling profits because of growing competition, the LSE inadvertantly played into its rivals' hands as traders found themselves unable to do business during a key part of the day, with all order driven securities put in an auction period. This outage followed a number of recent technical glitches for the LSE, and comes just over a year after a seven hour halt in trading. Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, said: As far as glitches go, the London Stock Exchange couldn't have picked a worse day. Traders were sat at their desks twiddling their thumbs for three hours while the LSE sorted out their issues, although those with access switched to trading on alternative exchanges. Once trading did resume on the main bourse, traders continued dumping stocks. The banking sector was hit the hardest as concerns over exposure to the Middle East forced traders to reduce positions. Ironically, the LSE itself was caught up in the Middle Eastern problems, since Borse Dubai holds a 20.56% stake in the company. With the prospect of this being dumped on the market, not to mention its trading problems, shares in the LSE fell 60p to 754.5p. Rival BATS told its clients they could continue to trade during the outage, while Chi-X complained that instigating an auction period meant trading could not be routed to its systems. It called on the Financial Services Authority to get involved to ensure \"the continuation of trading and an orderly market.\" Investors' nerves are likely to be severely tested before the Middle Eastern markets and Wall Street reopen, as concerns grow about the financial health of Dubai and indeed the whole Gulf region. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index said: Whether or not the problems at Dubai will be enough to create spin off affects into other sectors remains to be seen but this cannot be discarded in the near term. The key issue now is that any company that has direct or indirect links to Dubai now has a question mark over it and with the markets making some strong gains of late, investors have taken no chances today and have moved to cash in their profits. The combination of a full valuation, inadequate diversification, and regulatory risks around its main annuity product line, high risky asset leverage and operational risks around the strategic shift to savings products drives our new sell recommendation. The company has recently been the subject of bid speculation but we believe that an acquisition is unlikely unless the regulatory risks around capital are fully known. This is not expected to be clarified till mid-2010.", "London Stock Exchange crash halts trading The system ground to a halt at 10.35 this morning and did not resume until 2pm while the organisation searched for the fault. A spokesman said: \"There were connectivity problems for a number of customers. Some customers were having intermittent connectivity. Some people could execute trades and some people couldn't. \"We went into an auction call period where everyone could put trades on or take them off the system, but there was no execution of trade. The underlying order book was still working.\" Today's problems come just a day after the LSE reported a 38% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a379.4m for the six months to September. The business is facing lower share trading volumes as well as increasing competition from rival trading platforms such as Chi-X and Turquoise. During October an average \u00a35bn worth of shares a day were traded on the LSE. In September last year, City traders were also left powerless when a computer crash paralysed the market for seven hours during what should have been one of its busiest sessions of the year.

The pensions regulator said today that many of the 7,200 firms with final salary schemes were delaying making payments for several years after they included predictions of rising asset prices in calculations to determine how much money they set aside for pension funds. Companies also justified delaying payments to their funds after they agreed with the regulator that top-up funds would be more affordable in the future when profits were higher. The regulator said it was monitoring recovery plans following concerns that agreements made before the recession were overly optimistic. The report by the regulator is likely to spark further debate over the funding problems faced by Britain's final salary pension schemes. In his last report the regulator said the collective deficit of all funds was around \u00a3200bn. Rises in life expectancy, low interest rates and predictions of possible increases in inflation are expected to increase funding costs and widen the shortfall in many schemes. The value of some companies, including British Airways, is already smaller than the pension scheme they are obliged to fund. Small changes in pension liabilities can add hundreds of millions of pounds to funding costs. Earlier this year the regulator signalled he would take a hard line against employers that sought to delay payments in order to drive up profits and pay dividends to shareholders. But in recent months he has taken a softer line and agreed several recovery plans that extend payments beyond a standard 10-year target. David Norgrove, the chairman of the pensions regulator, said schemes were divided into three groups depending on when they made their funding predictions. He said deals with the regulator made several years ago would need to be watched closely. \"The three tranches of scheme valuations have been conducted in very different economic circumstances and this analysis explores some of the effects that the downturn, and other factors such as longevity improvements, have had on scheme funding,\" he said. \"We urge trustees to continue to take a prudent approach to assessing schemes' technical provisions, to maintain an honest and open dialogue with employers, and to remain aware of the changing economic situation as they focus on the long-term interests of scheme members. The regulator will continue to focus on this shared goal.\" Employers are expected to suffer a dramatic rise in pension costs this year after a fall in bond yields used to calculate occupational scheme funding positions. Pension experts report an acceleration of scheme closures in recent months as finance directors seek to offset escalating costs by minimising the number of people eligible for generous pensions."], "2009-10-B2": ["FTSE finishes higher as miners make up for poor GDP numbers The worst UK recession on record following a shock fall in third quarter GDP - and the stock market moves higher, led by mining groups and banks. Traders explained the discrepancy by saying the FTSE 100 had long ceased to be representative of the UK economy, with global influences proving a far more important factor. So a rebound in metal prices - with copper up to a one year high - lifted mining shares and thus the rest of the market. At the same time Credit Suisse upgraded the whole mining sector: We raise mining to benchmark (having downgraded in late May), buying into any weakness - and maintain our overweight of steel (a position we have had since March). We reiterate our overweight on Vedanta, and believe our thesis remains still intact (\u00a317 per share for 'business as is', \u00a315 for 'confirmed growth', \u00a320 for 'cost reduction' and \u00a36 for 'further growth'), even without a further commodity price rally.The key reason why this valuation anomaly remains, we think, is Vedanta pushing through with its programmes aggressively in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009, contributing to its towering growth profile, when other balance-sheet constrained companies were pulling back. The vast majority of the growth comes through in the next two calendar years and hence investors will not need to wait too long before the impact of the growth flows through to earnings. We acknowledge the corporate risks - e.g. [the current bid battle for] Asarco, abandoned corporate structure simplification move - but think this is more than reflected in the price. With the majority of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange relying on revenues from outside of the UK, today's poor UK GDP figures have largely been shrugged off, with investors preferring to concentrate on the US earnings season. The FTSE 100 did however fail to hold above 5280, a key resistance level, and this could put a roof on gains when the market re-opens next week. We also saw a number of investors cite falling US markets as motivation to lock in profits. It also emphasised its caution with regards to takeovers. It was outbid in an auction for a \"significant\" acquisition - supposedly by a private equity group - but the downside of that is it will take a \u00a31.9m charge for transaction costs. All in all though, the update lifted Filtrona's shares by 13p to 172.8p and analyst Andrew Darke at Ambrian issued a buy note on the business. As Hardy is not operator and therefore unable to dictate the pace of drilling, we would wait until drilling of the next well is confirmed before considering getting back into the stock. As such, we are downgrading Hardy to underperform from outperform and lower our target price to 250p from 400p.", "FTSE 100 shrugs off poor GDP figures as miners gain ground If there was ever a clear sign of the disconnection between the UK stock market and the UK economy, it has come in the reaction of the FTSE 100 to the shock GDP figures. The biggest influence of course is the mining sector, which is affected by global issues and not just UK economic news, no matter how bad. So with copper up again at a year's high and gold holding firm, investors are still backing the sector. We reiterate our overweight on Vedanta, and believe our 'Path to 50' thesis remains still intact (\u00a317 per share for 'business as is', \u00a315 for 'confirmed growth', \u00a320 for 'cost reduction' and \u00a36 for 'further growth'), even without a further commodity price rally.

Meanwhile Credit Suisse upgraded the whole mining sector: We raise mining to benchmark (having downgraded in late May), buying into any weakness-and maintain our overweight of steel (a position we have had since March). We upgrade mining because: a) global excess liquidity is at an all-time high and leads commodities by a year; b) industrial commodities tend to peak four months after the peak in IP momentum (ie, the middle of the first quarter of 2010) and when manufacturing inventories peak; c) China should grow at 9-10% GDP until 2011 and commodity prices can rise even when China's investment growth slows (as in 2004); d) China may diversify some of its $2.3tn of foreign exchange reserves into commodities given its strategic needs and an undervalued currency); e) companies, stock prices and analysts in general are discounting prices 20-45% below spot; f) unusually, the sector has lagged emerging markets. What stops us from going overweight mining is inventory build in China, China's investment share of GDP standing at 42% and the seasonality of commodity prices.

But he stresses that the UK has traditionally underperformed at the start of new global growth cycles, such as where we potentially find ourselves right now. In research entitled \"Putting UK Equities into a Global Context\", Secker comments: \"Any increase in investor concern over the UK economy and/or political situation is unlikely to be a big negative for UK equities per se; if anything, the associated GBP weakness is a positive support. \"However, we believe we are at the start of a new global growth cycle and such periods have historically seen the UK underperform given its more defensive characteristics. For this reason we recommend investors adopt a modest underweight in the UK.\" His examples of instances when UK equities underperform include when: short rates start rising; economic growth is recovering; when global equities are rising. \"Such underperformance reflects the lower cyclical weighting in the UK,\" adds Secker. He underlines the point about where the UK stock market makes its money with calculations that that just 35% of UK stock market revenues come from the UK versus 43% from other developed regions and 22% from emerging markets. A weak pound could also see M&A activity rise in UK sectors such as materials, capital goods, pharmaceuticals and telecoms, where UK valuations are cheaper than their international peers, the note predicts.", "Sharp increase in hard-hit companies exiting junior stock market Aim Although the overall number of delistings from Aim fell from 72 to 65 in the quarter, the number leaving Aim owing to financial stress or insolvency rose from seven to 27, according to a report out today. Laurence Sacker of Hacker Young added: \"For those companies bleeding cash and who cannot find supportive funders, the economy's gradual recuperation may come too late. We can expect financial stress to continue to be a common reason offered by companies for delisting.\" Apart from running into financial difficulties, the most common reason for a company to leave Aim was because it was taken over by or merged with another business. But due to the economic downturn the number of such deals has also fallen, from 29 in the third quarter of 2008 to 15 in the same period this year.

Portugal's PSI 20 is also down around 4%, while the cost of protecting the debt of a number of European countries has also jumped.

The euro has tumbled to a one-year low against the dollar, down 1% to $1.3048. Banking shares are among the major fallers, on concerns about their exposure to Greece and the other European countries. Miners are also under pressure after a new Australian tax was proposed over the weekend which could knock their earnings and delay development projects. Sterling-priced bullion hit a high of \u00a3783.33 an ounce and gold also set records in euros and Swiss francs. Spot gold in dollars hit $1,188.86 an ounce, the highest since early December. German economy minister Rainer Br\u00fcderle added to the uncertainty by telling Reuters that the \u20ac110bn package was not intended to cover Greece's entire financial requirements for the next three years. Instead, Br\u00fcderle suggested, Greece will need to return to the financial markets in perhaps 18 months to satisfy its borrowing needs. Br\u00fcderle's warning helped to knock the Greek banking sector down by almost 6% today in Athens, where public sector workers began a two-day strike in protest at the austerity measures demanded by the International Monetary Fund. The cost of insuring Greek debt from default rose, wiping out some of Monday's falls. Spanish and Portuguese credit default swaps were also up, showing there was still concern that the crisis would spread from Athens to the eurozone's weaker members. Germany continued to take a tough line against Greece, having finally agreed to contribute \u20ac22bn to the rescue effort. Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said that Greece would be plunged into insolvency if it failed to meet its promises to raise taxes across the economy, increase the retirement age to 65, and cut the size of its public sector. \"If there are any violations, payments will be stopped. Then Athens will once again be threatened with bankruptcy,\" Sch\u00e4uble told the Rheinische Post newspaper.

This would intensify the pressure on ratings agencies to downgrade the UK's sovereign rating from AAA and make fiscal consolidation even more difficult.\" \"The longer any political discussions [over forming a coalition] drag on for, the more nervous financial markets can expect to become, standing to weaken further both sterling and UK equities.\" Parker told Bloomberg television that the Liberal Democrats' expected insistence on electoral form in return for forming a possible coalition with Labour \"could be a negative for the market\" as \"markets want focus on how to address the budget deficit [first]\". Lewis told Bloomberg: \"This is going to be a normal correction \u2013 we are in a sideways volatile era you get after a deep recession. It's too soon to call and end to the recovery in the economy or stock markets.\" Lannoo told Bloomberg in Brussels that policymakers and politicians did not understand the markets' reaction to Greece's financial crisis. \"They lack understanding. They can't just say the markets are speculators. They can only react on a signal and they don't have one [right now]. They have to listen to them because the next bubble will be government debt.\" He said that he did not expect today's emergency eurozone summit to result in a wideranging enough response to shore up markets and prevent contagion to weaker European economies like Spain and Portugal.", "General election 2010: Can Dow Jones index predict UK election winner? As Britain finally goes to the polls, one of the more esoteric indicators of who might lead the next government \u2013 the US stock market \u2013 is predicting a win for the Conservative party. But the weakness in equity markets this week has seen the Dow swing from supporting Labour to backing a Conservative victory. The Dow started last week at 11205 \u2013 its highest point since the election was called and well above its 10969 close on 6 April. But last night the Dow closed down at 10868. As the oldest stock market index for which data is readily available, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, established in 1896, provides an intriguing and consistent indicator of UK election results. The only setbacks to the Dow's otherwise unblemished record came in the elections of 1987 and 2005. However, in both those elections the prime ministers who won the voters' support did not see out their full term. Margaret Thatcher won the 1987 election but was subsequently replaced by John Major. Tony Blair won the 2005 election but later gave way to Gordon Brown. What makes the Dow's consistency more compelling is that there are no obvious market factors which influence its performance and the data spans times of war, recession, crises and disasters and bull and bear markets. Nor is there any correlation between the rate of growth in the Dow and the UK election. It took the Dow 28 years to double to 500, 16 to double to 1,000, 15 to double to 2,000, 8 years to reach 4,000 and 2 years to double to 8,000 in 1997. Since 1997, the year the current Labour Party came to power, the Dow breached 14,000 in 2007 but has still, after 13 years, not doubled up on the 8,000 level. The performance of the Dow over the course of an election campaign may regularly predict the winning party but gives no insight into that party's majority, or indeed whether it has one. A big movement does not mean a big majority. When Stanley Baldwin led the Conservatives to power in 1924 with a massive 210-seat majority, the Dow Jones had fallen by just one point in predicting his victory. However, ahead of the last hung parliament in 1974, the movement on the Dow was just 5 points representing a rise of less than 1%. Based on the 6 April 2010 close, a 1% movement on the Dow would be 106 points. Last night the Dow closed 101 points below its level at the start of the election campaign. The Dow is therefore in hung parliament territory and while it and the FTSE 100 are pointing to the Conservatives as the winning party, the Dow is also fulfilling conditions which could point to a strong showing for the Liberal Democrats. The FTSE 100 closed at 5780.4 on 6, April and at yesterday's close at 5341.9 is still well down on the campaign opening level and thus favouring David Cameron. The Liberal Democrats must go back to the early 20th Century to find any comfort from the Dow's performance. The last time the Liberal party, as it then was, formed a government after an election held on a day when the US market was open was in January 1911. The key for the Liberal Democrats was that the victory came on a day when, for the second election in succession, the Dow closed at a level still below its previous closing high for that century achieved on a UK election day. The Dow's 20th century election day peak was achieved on 13 February 1906 when it closed at 100. The Dow closed at 89 on the day of the following election and at 85 when the Liberals formed a government in 1911. The 21st century peak for the Dow on a UK election day came in June 2001 when it closed at 11090. At the last election in 2005 the Dow closed at 10340. With the Dow below that 11090 election day peak last night, the Liberal Democrats will be hoping history repeats itself."], "2010-4-B2": ["Reckitt disappoints as FTSE falls 2.6% on Greek junk rating As leading shares suffered their biggest one day fall since November on sovereign debt worries, the consumer goods company behind the likes of Cillit Bang and Vanish was a major faller after its results disappointed investors. At first glance a 15% increase in first quarter operating profit to \u00a3348m looked impressive, with a strong start to the year and delays to generic competition to its Suboxone heroin substitute. On top of that it revealed an Office of Fair Trading enquiry into alleged anti-competitive behaviour concerning its gaviscon heartburn treatment, for which it plans to make a provision. In theory the OFT could fine Reckitt up to 10% of its \u00a38bn total turnover, if it rules against the company. Analysts James Edwardes Jones and Martin Dolan at Execution Noble said: We are not blown away by either the quantity or quality of these results and remain holders. This will not go down as a vintage set of results by Reckitt's standards. In large part this is a function of the height to which they have raised the bar when it comes to reporting. But it has to be said that underlying revenue growth of 5% is at the lower end of consumer companies that have reported so far and is unusually no better than Reckitt's guidance.

City analysts specialising in the clean-technology sector believe there is little chance of Engyco being launched in the next couple of weeks as scheduled given the negative noises coming out of Madrid. \"This is nothing less than a catastrophe\" for investors, said Stephane Aderca, an energy analyst at Liberum Capital in London. \"We had believed that a promise [to pay a certain level of subsidy] is a promise.

Or possibly not. The City thinks a Conservative victory in the forthcoming election would be the best outcome for the stock market. The best result for UK equities is likely to be an outright victory for the Conservative party. Although an outright Labour victory would help create certainty, the lack of urgency in their deficit reduction plans may be negative for gilt yields and may alert the rating agencies. But he adds a caveat: If gilt yields aren't negatively impacted by a Labour victory then their 'spending for longer' policy may actually be better for markets than a Conservative administration committed to fiscal cut-backs. Ironically mild sovereign concerns are also positive for UK equities. Around 65% of FTSE 100 revenues come from overseas and therefore benefit from currency weakness. Clearly there is a fine line here and the risk is that sovereign weakness eventually hits gilt yields. So arguably the most important thing to watch in the days, weeks and months ahead is how gilt yields respond to the new administration. If they can retain the confidence of the gilt market then we can have a more optimistic path ahead than if they lose such confidence. On a hung parliament, Deutsche says: As for a Conservative majority: And finally, if Labour manage to buck the polls and hold on to power: Some of the companies exposed to spending cuts that may have underperformed in anticipation of a Conservative win may see a relief rally (mainly smaller companies). However, the problem of government finances remains and there is no guarantee that the risk of a sovereign downgrade would be averted.

Desire Petroleum told the stock market this morning that exploratory drilling beneath the seabed surrounding the South Atlantic territory had found oil deposits, but warned that early evidence suggests they may not be commercially viable. The bad news sent its shares tumbling more than 50%, and hit other companies in the sector. Desire was the first company to put Ocean Guardian to use. It dug more than 3,500 metres, and hit hydrocarbon deposits around 2,550 metres. However, early analysis showed \"that oil may be present in thin intervals but that reservoir quality is poor\". It warned that until it has analysed the data further it will not know whether the well needs to be \"drilled deeper, suspended for testing or plugged and abandoned\". Shares in Desire plunged by nearly 60% when trading began, down 58p at 41p. Rockhopper Exploration, which owned 7% of Desire's well, tumbled 35%. Desire is expected to announce further results from the well, called Liz 14/19-1, later this week. Alan Sinclair, analyst at stockbrokers Seymour Pierce, argued that all may not be lost. \"On balance, whilst the market may have been looking for seagull-scorching test results from Liz, it should be borne in mind that this is the first of a potential six-well programme by Desire.

Angry shareholders, including UK Financial Investments \u2013 which looks after the taxpayers' stake in the bailed-out banks \u2013 appear to have convinced the bank's remuneration committee to promise to take more care in deciding bonuses next year. In his statement in the annual report, Berndt said: \"Reflecting shareholder concern on this matter, the committee will review performance against the targets for the 2010 plans, taking into account the overall operating performance in the business in determining how much any bonus will be paid out. \"The committee also reserves the right to exercise its discretion in reducing any payment that otherwise would have been earned, if they deem this appropriate.\" But he also expresses concern about the overall pay levels. \"The committee does have concerns that by continuing to hold base pay levels at 2008 levels, remuneration for the executive directors is likely to become uncompetitive versus our peer group,\" he said. Daniels' base salary of \u00a31m is enhanced by benefits that took his total pay to \u00a31.1m \u2013 down on the \u00a31.5m he received in 2008.

Neptune's economist, James Dowey, chips in with dismal figures on Japan's GDP. It's \u00a5500tn (\u00a33.7tn), but was at the same nominal level more than a decade ago. This is a country that is flatlining. How do corporates react in such an unfavourable environment? The answer is to cut investment, capital expenditure and wages. And in aggregate, it means no one increases their bottom line. Companies can't raise profitability and face a vicious downward spiral. So why has he brought a group of financial journalists to Tokyo? To write that investors should dump his fund? This has got to be the oddest press trip on record \u2026 But Taylor hasn't lost his marbles. He doesn't buy Japan. What he buys is Japanese companies. In sector after sector, he says he can find three or four companies that are world class and which are often the dominant global player in their market. He takes us to Toray Industries. In the 1950s it was competing against Britain's Courtaulds in the rayon market. Soon, Toray was facing the same sort of price competition that drove Courtaulds from the market. But instead of rolling over it invested in research and development, seeking new markets for materials. Now it's the world leader in carbon-fibre technology with global sales of some $12bn (\u00a37.9bn). Half its manufacturing plants are in Japan, and inevitably the business took a hammering when demand imploded as the global recession began to bite. Its response says a lot about Japanese capitalism. Senior vice-president Norihiko Saitou tells us it embarked on cost-cutting which included 30% pay cuts for board members, the axing of bonuses for managers and the end of overtime. But redundancies were out of the question. \"It is a very important company policy not to lay off people,\" he tells us, through an interpreter. It has a 30-year plan for carbon fibres, a lightweight material that is replacing steel in aeroplanes and cars, and so substantially reduces weight and energy use. Boeing has signed it up to supply materials for its Dreamliner.It's this approach which may explain why Toray is a world leader and Courtaulds a shadow of its former self. And Toray's share price is around \u00a5505, up 43% from \u00a5353 last March. Taylor reckons scores of Japanese companies such as Toray are ideally placed to benefit from not just the recovery in world trade but the coming boom. Global GDP was $55tn in 2007. He believes it will be $80tn by 2015, but most of that growth will be in non-OECD countries. \"The Chinese haven't even begun to gear up,\" he says. Japan is the biggest investor in China, directly and through companies the Japanese control in Taiwan. Taylor's strategy is to buy Japanese multinationals, avoid stocks exposed to the moribund domestic economy and hedge the currency. He is a big fan of hedging and warns of the value traps that so often ensnare investors in Japan. His analysis of global debt took him out of banks and real estate in 2007. He's back in financials and multinationals now but is fully hedged in the belief that the yen will fall. He finds the domestic economic situation in Japan almost comically bad, with a paralysed and corrupted political class unable to cope with the daunting challenges of a rapidly ageing population and colossal fiscal deficit. Shigeki Morinobu, president of the Japan Tax Institute, shows us a graph that makes Alistair Darling's budget challenge look like child's play. Government spending this year will be around \u00a5100tn, tax receipts around \u00a537tn. Japan is hooked on government spending so far in excess of what it raises in taxes that it just can't find a way out. Much of that money goes on pensions and healthcare for the elderly, where the bill just keeps rising. Government debt has topped 200% of GDP, and financing it from famously thrifty Japanese households can't go on much longer. The savings ratio has plummeted from 20% of national income two decades ago to 2% today. Crunch time for Japan could come in the 2011 budget. Government spending, which has propped up the economy since the bubble burst in the early 1990s, must fall. Taxes may have to rise. Either way, it makes the prospect for the domestic economy grim. But it will force a substantial devaluation of the yen, which will help Taylor's holdings in those Japanese multinationals. JO Hambro's Scott McGlashan, who has one of the longest records of investing in Japan, believes 2010 will be a strong year for the Tokyo stock market. \"On most metrics, Japanese equities are near historically cheap levels,\" he says. \"Strong research and development bodes well for Japanese trade and innovation over the long term.\" But investment consultant Allenbridge warns that Japan has been the most disappointing major stock market in the world over the past 20 years, with the Nikkei 225 at barely a quarter of its 1989 peak. \"There have been false dawns galore, with 'stale' bulls pinning their hopes on the old saw of what goes down must eventually go up. There have been short-term blips but it has been a depressing long-term experience.\" However it now believes Tokyo \"may finally offer good opportunities, provided investors pick carefully\".", "Lloyds predicts return to profit Lloyds Banking Group cheered its long-suffering shareholders this morning by predicting a return to profit this year, after incurring fewer bad debts than feared in recent weeks. The bank, which is 41% owned by the taxpayer following its takeover of HBOS two years ago, told the City that trading had been \"strong\" in the first 10 weeks of the year. It is keeping a tight lid on costs, which are lower than in the same period in 2009. The bank's net interest margin is still in line with recent guidance and this has supported \"a good level of income growth\". \"Impairment provisions are currently trending at lower levels than anticipated and as a result the group now expects to deliver a better impairment performance than previously guided, in both the retail and corporate businesses, in 2010,\" Lloyds said in an unscheduled trading statement. \"Overall \u2026 the group believes that it will be profitable on a combined businesses basis in 2010.\" The upbeat statement boosted shares in Britain's banks, and sent Lloyds shares up 8% to 60p in early trading. Royal Bank of Scotland gained nearly 6% to 44.45p, and Barclays rose almost 2% to 359.6p. \"We did this impromptu update because there is a material improvement in the performance,\" said a Lloyds spokesman. \"We felt in the ten weeks of trading since Christmas the trends are better than we expected. These are the first signs of an encouraging performance in the year ahead.\" But he added that the improvement is \"not really a reflection of general market conditions\" but specific to Lloyds' customers. Today's comments will calm fears about UK banks after Standard & Poor's warned yesterday that lenders remain vulnerable to a deterioration in loan quality and money markets. The rating agency said there is \"limited scope\" for banks to increase profits over the next two years. \"Into 2010, we consider that UK banks will remain pressured by elevated loan impairments. Our expectation of a slow economic recovery may prolong the period in which losses are elevated relative to historic averages,\" S&P said in a report. Analysts at Redburn Partners noted that the commercial property market ended 2009 on a high with an 8% rise in capital values in the fourth quarter, underpinned by the highest level of investment activity since autumn 2007. \"This has materially positive ramifications for Lloyds' most troubled loan book.\" Lloyds will update on trading again on 27 April. Today's comments are part of a presentation which Daniels will give to investors at the Morgan Stanley European financials conference on Wednesday. \"In general banks have been very bullish in client meetings post their results. Given that interest rates are at a 350-year low, it is not surprising that credit quality is improving,\" said Bruce Packard at Seymour Pierce. \"But UK households are around three times more indebted than during the early 1990s recession, and consensus forecasts for growth look far too optimistic compared to how the banks grew income coming out of the last recession.\""], "2010-3-B1": ["Bartle Bogle Hegarty takes attack alarm spin-off to stock market Bartle Bogle Hegarty has taken to heart the advice about diversifying beyond advertising agencies' traditional creative work, with the stock market floatation of a subsidiary company that produces fashionable assault alarms for women.

A London listing for the private equity group travel booking business Travelport was postponed last month. Exit plans have yet to emerge for Blackstone's investments in United Biscuits and Tragus, the restaurant group behind Cafe Rouge and Strada. Blackstone has in recent weeks been among the buyout firms to have attracted criticism over the level of fees sought from prospective investors. Some $140m (\u00a393m) had been sought in connection with aborted attempts to list Travelport to help cover transaction advisory costs. Merlin, which has external net borrowings of about \u00a31bn, published selective figures for the year to 26 December today , which it said showed \"the resilience of our business model\". It is not expected to publish its statutory accounts for some months. Nick Varney, chief executive, said: \"We are delighted with Merlin's performance in 2009. In the midst of a deep global recession we welcomed over three million more visitors to our attractions.\" Asked about plans for a stock market flotation, Varney said: \"News of the demise of our plans to IPO [initial public offering] are somewhat premature.\" With no major debts maturing before 2012, he claimed Merlin was \"under no immediate pressure\" to find an exit route for its private-equity backers. It emerged last month that one of Blackstone's fellow investors in Merlin, Dubai International Capital, had quietly sold two-thirds of its 18% equity holding in the business to the founding Lego family, led by Kjeld Kirk Kirstiansen, as long ago as last summer. The transaction saw the family increase its interest to 34%, making it the second-largest investor behind Blackstone, which has 50%.

The decision comes amid growing concerns about the future of swaths of British companies that are shouldering debts raised by the private equity \u00adindustry during the boom years, and warnings that tens of thousands of jobs could be at risk. Acromas has \u00a36bn of borrowings and was widely tipped as a prime candidate for listing, but senior managers have now taken the unusual step for a private equity-financed vehicle of ruling out a float for at least 12 months. Despite Acromas's steep borrowings, its executives argue that potential investors will look beyond the numbers when it eventually seeks a public listing. \"I think investors will focus on the strength of the management, the strength of the brand and the strength of the underlying business,\" said \u00adStuart Howard, Acromas's chief financial officer. \"But I accept that the discussion on the appropriate level of debt for the business will be important.\" The owners of Acromas \u2013 CVC Capital Partners, Permira and Charterhouse \u2013 are among the three biggest names in private equity. They will have to convince potential investors that raising cash on the stock market is more about funding future growth than paying down huge debt. It is a challenge emblematic of issues facing the wider leveraged buyout community, which has racked up a $3tn (\u00a31.9tn) leveraged buyout, property and securitisation debt pile. That mountain of bank borrowing is seen by many experts on distressed debt as an economic and corporate car crash waiting to happen. The vast majority of the $3tn debt needs refinancing in a five-year time\u00adframe starting in 2012. Experts believe up to 60% of loans will fail. This implies a huge number of private equity-owned firms \u2013 estimated to be almost a fifth of corporate Britain \u2013 will fold, having a potentially devastating impact on jobs. Failure to refinance loans will see private equity firms hit with swingeing financial penalties. The need to repay debt ahead of that deadline is why private equity wants to find exits. The longer it holds investments, the more of its debt it has to repay. And the more likely it is that subsequent private equity fundraising will also fail. \"The private equity model is based on the idea that the period of ownership is reasonably limited,\" a senior investment manager said. \"If the period holding [a company] is longer, it makes it harder to attract new money. For investors, they rely on returns to finance the next round. \"And I don't think debt markets will come back to the level they were in 2006,\" the manager said. Therefore, there will be refinancing issues. It's a big problem looming.\" Already, investors in private equity are taking fright. In a report out last week from the financial research group Preqin, 25% of investment managers said they were unsure when they would next invest in a private equity funding round. A further 8% were not planning to invest for at least a year. This represents a sea change in sentiment. In 1999, institutional investment totalled $329bn, rising to $929bn in 2009. Most of this cash came from \u00adpension funds. Those same pension funds have been called on to back public listings but since Debenhams, the high-street retailer, raised \u00a3950m in 2006, its shares have fallen 66%. Of the world's 20 biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) involving private equity in 2006 and 2007 \u2013 the peak of the last IPO cycle \u2013 only six trade above their offer prices, according to Thomson Reuters data. \"The definition of solvency is based on a company's ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due and that is exactly what we do,\" Howard said. The company's auditors certainly have no reason to disagree with this, and a \u00adsimple analysis of the cash available to Acromas also confirms Howard's assertion. At the year end, it had \u00a3140m of available cash, an increase of \u00a330m. This is all underpinned by a trading \u00adperformance that is seemingly coping well with difficult economic circumstances. \"The business is performing in line with plans, and cash generation is ahead of expectations because of falling interest rates,\" Howard said. \"We have no need to tap the markets.\" But despite such confidence, there is still a sense that Acromas is running up the down escalator. Not only does it have to deal with an unhelpful trading environment but it must do so under the strains imposed by carrying more than \u00a36bn of debt. Available cash may have increased by \u00a330m but net debt rose \u00a3269m. Acromas records an annual interest charge of more than \u00a3700m. The cash cost is somewhat less than that because \u00a3266m of interest costs are simply added to loan instruments held by investors. These subordinated preference certificates attract interest at an effective rate of 16.5%. They may not be repayable until 2037 but they represent an ever increasing debt burden. The Acromas management also takes comfort from the fact that its debt was provided under a \"covenant-light\" regime. A powerful and successful industry used its pre-credit crunch credentials to persuade banks to be less stringent in the conditions they imposed on companies to safeguard their lending. A more restrictive covenant regime may have been less sympathetic to the Acromas balance sheet, which boasts only \u00a3227m of tangible fixed assets and \u00a3426m of net current assets to support \u00a36bn of debt. The last thing Acromas needs is \u00addeteriorating relations with its workforce. And yet, the AA section of the group is threatened with industrial action for the first time in its history. Restrictions to its defined contributions pension scheme could spark strikes among a workforce that has already seen the loss of 4,000 jobs since falling under private equity ownership four years ago. While Acromas may have its debt financed under covenant-light terms, it must hope that nothing untoward affects the day-to-day business as it tries to repay banks and inch towards an exit. Alliance Boots boasts of its \"commitment to be at the forefront of best practice corporate governance reporting\". It cites publication of its financial statement as an example of its transparency. But trying to unravel what is really going on behind the figures set out in the high-street chemist chain's latest accounts for the year ended March 2009 is far from easy. Since the company is so heavily geared, it is important to be able to gauge the true extent of its financial liabilities. But here the accounts become less transparent. The carrying value of borrowings on the balance sheet is \u00a39.6bn. But the accounts also provide a figure for the contractual maturity of its financial liabilities, which includes the interest costs relating to those borrowings. On that basis, the borrowings rise to \u00a313.5bn. Alliance Boots has total financial liabilities on the balance sheet of \u00a312.2bn, which rise to \u00a316.2bn on a contractual maturity basis. To confuse matters further, it is clear from the accounts that none of these figures bears any relationship to what is going on in the real world of the debt markets. A note to the accounts on exceptional items reveals that the market price of the company's debt had been savaged by the turmoil of the credit crunch. Alliance Boots bought back some its own debt, principally mezzanine finance, with a nominal value of \u00a3191m. But the price it paid in the market yielded a discount of \u00a3106m \u2013 the ultimate buy one get one free. Despite its huge debt mountain, Alliance Boots still boasts net assets in excess of \u00a34bn. However, more than \u00a310bn, well over half its total assets, are represented by intangibles such as goodwill and brands.\u00a0 When the private equity deal was struck in 2007, the company envisaged using its tangible assets to refinance the balance sheet. A sale and leaseback of property and securitisation of receivables were seen as ways to help cut debt. But neither deal made financial sense against a backdrop of market turmoil and falling interest rates. Lower interest rates work to the company's advantage but it still had to shoulder finance costs in excess of \u00a31bn in the year to March. Once these have been met there is not much by way of surplus. The company made pre-tax profits of just \u00a313m. Of the \u00a330m of free cash generated, about \u00a317m was whittled away by currency translations. Andy Hornby, group chief executive, delivered an upbeat message last month when reporting on the third-quarter performance. But he recognised that 2010 would be another tough year. Alliance Boots may not have to start making its biggest debt repayments until 2014 but\u00a0 a difficult trading environment combined with unforgiving financial markets can only accelerate the point at which it begins to contemplate more aggressively that imposing milestone\u00a0 \u2013 or is it millstone?", "Superdry owner SuperGroup plans stock-market flotation It is understood that SuperGroup will launch institutional and retail share offers, raising about \u00a3125m to fund expansion plans and allowing management to take some cash off the table. The three would have had valuations of between \u00a31.2bn and \u00a32bn, and blamed the volatile market for forcing them to call off their plans. However, all three are private equity backed, and some fund managers are known to have balked at their high valuations and levels of debt. Had they joined the market successfully, there was a long queue of other private equity-backed companies hoping to follow suit. One industry expert said that the prospect of an IPO was a \"last get-out-of-jail card\" for many private equity-owned businesses, which could now face difficult refinancing problems and the prospect of being taken over by their lenders in debt-for-equity swaps. New Look had hoped to raise \u00a3650m to pay down some of its \u00a31bn debt pile, which includes a hugely expensive \"payment in kind\" loan agreement, taken out to pay a dividend to the retailer's backers. The fashion chain is controlled by the private-equity groups Permira and Apax Partners, with its founder, Tom Singh, and the management also owning sizeable stakes. Another firm, Promethean, which is behind the whiteboards used in schools across the world, is also expected to confirm plans for an IPO today. Although it is private equity backed, it has not been saddled with huge debts. SuperGroup, however, is debt free. The brand, launched only six years ago, is the brainchild of Julian Dunkerton, whose chain of Cult boutiques is also part of SuperGroup, and James Holder, who previously developed the Bench label. Dunkerton, who started his business in 1985 with a market stall and a \u00a340-a-week grant under Margaret Thatcher's enterprise allowance scheme, owns 52% of the business, while Holder and sales director Theo Karpathios account for 20%. SuperGroup could be valued at up to \u00a3400m and a successful float would turn all three into multimillionaires. Cheltenham-based Superdry, and its trademark orange label, have reached near-cult status among teenagers and twentysomethings. It sells a range of street-style clothing and has celebrity fans such as David Beckham and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, even though it does not pay famous faces to endorse its clothes. Last month it unveiled a 29% increase in like-for-like sales in the five weeks to Christmas, on top of a 27% rise the previous year. Total sales over the past year almost doubled to \u00a3119m. The group, which employs 1,000 staff, opened 17 new stores last year, taking its total to 40. It also has 54 concessions in House of Fraser, where it is one of the best-selling labels. The Superdry brand is sold in 30 countries and the group also has wholesale and online operations. It is understood that Keith Edelman, a veteran retailer whose most recent job was as chief executive of Arsenal football club and who is a former Wal-Mart executive, have also been lined up. The \u00adcompany declined to comment on its \u00adflotation plans."], "2010-2-B1": ["Promethean forges ahead with flotation The company behind the educational whiteboards used in schools across the world is understood to be planning to join the stock market, despite the decision by three far bigger companies to pull the plug on their own plans. Promethean, based in Blackburn, makes a range of hi-tech educational kit, including whiteboards and handheld classroom devices for children, and is expected to confirm next week \u2013 possibly as early as Monday \u2013 that it is pressing the button on an initial public offer likely to value the business at up to \u00a3500m. Although Promethean is backed by Apax, which invested in 2004, unlike other companies with private equity investors who have abandoned their IPOs in the last three days \u2013 New Look, Travelport and Merlin Entertainment \u2013 Promethean has not been saddled with massive debts. Apax is expected to sell its entire stake, which will be worth \u00a3100m-\u00a3125m. Promethean has carved itself a profitable niche in the educational technology sector and is second in the whiteboard market behind Canada's Smart Technologies. It leads the embryonic market for handheld classroom devices for pupils. The company also has an online community of more than half a million teachers worldwide who use its portal \u2013 Promethean Planet \u2013 to swap lesson plans and teaching tips. They can also download paid-for lesson plans. The company was founded just over a decade ago by Tony Cann, now vice-chairman, who owns just over 50% of the business.

Non-executives include film producer Lord Puttnam and Philip Rowley, former boss of AOL Europe.", "New Look pulls planned stock market flotation Young fashion chain New Look's ambition to rejoin the stock market was dashed today as the private equity-owned retailer was forced to scrap its flotation plans. New Look blamed the \"unfavourable market backdrop\" and said it had been a \"difficult decision\". The sale prospectus had been due for publication on Monday, when bookbuilding \u2013 signing up investors \u2013 was due to begin. However, some fund managers had balked at being asked to put up cash to repay private equity debts. The float, announced only 10 days ago, was called off after a crisis board meeting this morning. It capped two days which have destroyed the hopes of the private equity sector for a series of big, successful stockmarket listings for their investments. If successful, the three big floats would have heralded a flood of other private equity-backed companies joining the market as a way for financiers to crystallise their profits. Their failure, said one private equity expert, represented PE's \"last 'get out of jail' card\" before some of the companies they bought face financial crisis. The collapse of the IPOs is also bad news for investment bankers, who had hoped the share offerings would have produced huge advisory fees. New Look was acquired by Permira and Apax Partners in 2004. Founder Tom Singh has a stake, as has the store's senior management team. Chief executive Carl McPhail said: \"We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the initial public offering as a result of the considerable volatility in the equity markets.\" He said the group still wanted to return to the stock market: \"We remain convinced of the strengths of the New Look business and its suitability as a public company. New Look remains a great business with a great future. We will re-evaluate our options when market conditions improve.\" Today, however, a New Look spokesman said the retailer would not be constrained by its inability to float: \"They didn't have to do it at all. They have high levels of cash.\" The majority of the float proceeds had been earmarked to pay off an expensive \u00a3360m payment-in-kind loan, where interest rolls up and is repaid in a large sum at the end of the term. The PIK note was taken on to pay a dividend to New Look's backers and management. The backers and management had not revealed how many shares they were likely to cash in at flotation, but the listing would have turned the retailer's bosses into multi-millionaires. The decision to abandon the planned float is the second time the retailer's backers have failed to sell the business. A plan was dropped in 2007 when bids fell short of the company's target. Many now face the prospect of refinancing in a fragile market where banks are being very demanding. Some private equity experts believe many PE-backed businesses could now fall under the control of their lenders. Guy Fraser Sampson, a private equity expert at the Cass Business School, said the door slamming on IPOs was \"very bad news for the private equity industry\", which for some \"was the last 'get out of jail' card for them to keep up returns\". He said some PE-backed companies would be seized by their banks while investors who put cash into private equity funds \"must get used to much lower returns\". New Look may also have been hampered by suggestions that the prospects for retailers did not look good, as the impact of the recent VAT rise takes effect and tax rises loom. Retail shares have dropped more than 10% so far this year \u2013 double the decline in the FTSE-100. However, New Look had boasted about its market-beating sales growth and Don Williams, head of retail at accountants BDO, said it was the value being put on New Look that had caused it to fail, rather than the economic backdrop. \"Conditions have definitely improved for retailers compared to this time last year and fashion, in particular, has seen like-for-like growth. The postponement of New Look's IPO should not be seen as an indication of trouble on the high street. It is still a buyer's market at a corporate level and as such, prices must be realistic,\" he said.", "New Look pulls planned stock market flotation New Look has become the latest company to pull its planned stock market flotation, blaming turbulent markets. It is the second time in three years that the budget retailer, backed by private equity firms Permira and Apax, has abandoned plans for a float. It was hoping to raise \u00a3650m to cut its \u00a31bn debt pile, but did not meet with much enthusiasm from fund managers. Carl McPhail, New Look's chief executive, said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange: \"We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the initial public offering as a result of the considerable volatility in the equity markets. We remain convinced of the strengths of the New Look business and its suitability as a public company. We will re-evaluate our options when market conditions improve.\" While markets have expected a flurry of big stock market flotations this year, a number of companies have abruptly changed their minds in recent days.", "Markets volatile after mixed US jobs figures The keenly awaited US jobs report has provoked a volatile reaction from the stock market, as investors tried to read the runes of the figures. In the event, US employers cut 20,000 jobs in January rather than the increase expected by the market. In truth, the range was so wide that the consensus was for a 27,000 rise but it veered from positive to negative. If the raw number was \u2013 overall \u2013 disappointing then the unemployment rate edged down from 10% to a five-month low of 9.7%, when everyone was expecting a slight increase to 10.1%. Apart from suggesting that once more the experts were not exactly on the ball, the figures sent the market scrambling for direction. The initial reaction from the FTSE was to show a 100-point fall, but this soon pulled back to a decline of just over 50 points. At the moment the index is down 59.50 at 5079.81. The US futures have recovered from suggesting a 70-point fall at the open to a 7-point decline. Once thing is certain, however, and that is the market's uncertainty.", "Markets fall on widening deficit fears and rising US unemployment Doubts over Greece's ability to pay its debts extended to Spain, Portugal and eastern European countries, all labouring under high budget deficits. The cost of insuring $10m of Spain's sovereign debt rocketed to $162,000 (\u00a3103,000), twice as much as Britain and about four times the cost to insure Germany's bonds, according to Markit, the credit data provider. Portugal only raised \u20ac300m of the \u20ac500m it was expecting in a bond sale, further fuelling the uncertainty. In line with other leading European indexes, the FTSE 100 shed 2.2%, or 114 points, to close at 5,139.31, its lowest close in three months, with banks leading the way and shares in miners and oil companies under pressure from lower oil and commodity prices. In New York, the Dow Jones slipped below the 10,000 mark at one stage before closing 268 points lower at 10,002, a fall of 2.61%, after figures unexpectedly showed a rise in new claims for jobless benefits, raising fears that tomorrow's key non-farm payrolls data could be worse than expected. The Dow Jones has now fallen by more than 6.5% during the last two weeks. The US data also hit commodity and currency markets, amid investors' concerns about a double-dip recession. \"There is a renewed bout of risk aversion, there were expectations that the [US jobs] number would trend lower,\" said Tim Rees, a fund manager at Insight Investment. \"Although some company results were pretty good, the market is finding reasons to be bearish.\" Spain's economy minister, Elena Salgado, this week announced \u20ac50bn of budget cuts aimed at reducing the budget deficit to 3% of GDP \u2013 the European target \u2013 from a revised 11.4% at present. Spaniards are under pressure from the international financial community, as it will force the government to pay more for its debt.", "New Look to raise \u00a3650m in stock market flotation The fashion chain said it would use the cash being raised to cut its debt to \u00a3450m. With a much lower interest bill, said chief executive Carl McPhail, the retailer would be able to plough more cash into expansion plans. The company, majority-owned by private equity groups Apax and Permira, is likely to be valued at \u00a31.7bn. It was taken private in 2004 in a \u00a3700m deal and the retailer says \u00a3450m has been invested in the business since. New Look is among a number of companies queuing up to join the stock market after last year's share rally and its progress will be watched closely. Aside from the difficult economic backdrop the retailer could also be hampered by the \"Debenhams factor\" \u2013 a reference to the department store's return to the market in 2006 after a spell in private equity ownership had left it burdened with debt and with stores in need of refurbishment. A series of profits warnings followed and the shares dived. One fund manager told Reuters news agency yesterday he had \"no interest whatsoever\" in New Look's IPO. He said it was \"a fantastic company, but coming in at totally the wrong price for the debt structure\". New Look also intends to open more stores in Europe, where it currently has 58 outlets, and more franchised outlets in locations like the Middle East and Russia, where there are currently 44 stores. McPhail said discount fashion was growing nearly four times as fast as the overall clothing market and New Look is growing far faster than its rival cheap chic retailers. Only 3% of sales come via the internet, said the New Look boss, and there was more opportunity online and in men's clothing and childrenswear, which could only be realised with more store space. The float will turn New Look's senior management into multimillionaires, on paper at least, as it is not yet known how many shares they might cash in. The senior executives own 16% of the group, shares which are likely to be worth nearly \u00a3300m. New Look's founder Tom Singh, who was part of the group which took the business private in 2004, owns a 22.5% stake, expected to be valued at some \u00a3400m.", "Royal Bank leads the way as FTSE finishes on the front foot Shares in RBS ended up 2.56p at 34.86p despite earlier suggestions it had run into problems with the proposed $4bn sale of its jointly owned commodities business RBS Sempra to JPMorgan Chase. The talk was that President Obama's plans to stop proprietary trading by banks had forced JP Morgan to rethink its plans, and it might only buy the joint venture's oil operations and its non-US business. But even if that was the case, traders said RBS was likely to sell the rest - the US power and gas business - to its partner Sempra, and so would not be greatly disadvantaged. RBS has to sell the business following a ruling from the European Union. Meanwhile RBS played down talk it would sell and then lease back its flagship Scottish headquarters Gogarburn - the pet project of former chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin whose overambition led to the bank's near collapse until rescued by the UK taxpayer. An RBS spokesperson said: We constantly review all of our portfolio of property to ensure it is managed as efficiently as possible. Sale and leasebacks have been undertaken on many of our properties in the recent years but not for Gogarburn and we have no immediate plans to do so.

This was the first major correction we have seen since March last year \u2013 long overdue and very healthy. Northumbrian has been the subject of intermittent bid speculation in the past, and of course, there can be no guaranteed that a formal bid will materialise (Severn Trent and Pennon have also previously been rumoured to be targets). Current interest has apparently been sparked by the recent completion of Ofwat's regulatory price review for the period 2010-15. Northumbrian was one of the first to accept the industry regulator's final determination and has committed to increasing the dividend. The sector is likely to respond positively to any confirmation of renewed M&A activity.

The FT-SE 100 added 90 points, or 1.8%, to 5,105 points, also helped by the Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates at 0.5%. Hopes that cheap money will fuel demand for bank loans and consumption sent Lloyds Bank up 4.3%, or 2.5 pence, to 60.99p. Royal Bank of Scotland gained 1.5p, or 3.5%, 44.3p, while Barclays added 10.4p, or 3.5%, to 301.5p. \"The UK economy is still extremely fragile, and with a severe fiscal tightening on the way it is essential for monetary policy to support the recovery,\" said Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. The market also cheered news showing that Britain's manufacturing output grew at the fastest rate in nearly 16 years in May, following heavy downward revisions to April's numbers. European bank shares rose, boosted by the emergence of the first details of the EU stress tests -perceived to be less tough than expected. As many as 91 European banks will be tested on their ability to resist a financial shock, and may be asked to increase their capital buffers if appropriate. Confidence in that the tests will reassure investors over the Spanish banking system sent the price to protect $10bn of Spanish debt down by $15,000, to $232,000, an indication that investors have eased their fears about Spain following Greece into a bail-out.

We're dealing with much deeper change than most people realise.\" Gilts are bonds issued and backed by the government, offering almost zero risk (unless the government goes bust, something more cynical readers may believe to be imminent). When you invest in gilts you are effectively lending money to the government, which promises to pay you back the full amount (the principal) at a set date, along with interest (the coupon). All gilts are issued at 100p but can be traded, so you can sell or buy them before their redemption date for a potential gain or loss. Gilt yields rise and fall in line with the Bank of England base rate, but if you buy and hold you know exactly where you stand for both income and capital. \"The fact is, while you can worry about growth in China \u2013 it is so full of holes it's like an Aero bar \u2013 the Eurozone or the US, the long-term picture will tell you that a balanced portfolio across all asset classes (equities, bonds, gilts, property, commodities) should see investors alright, even if it is a bit dull; not equities alone, not gilts alone, but everything together. His colleague Ted Scott, manager of the F&C UK Growth & Income fund, says that a shift in assets (from equities to bonds) is \"entirely rational as expectations on the shape of the recovery were too bullish. In the UK, the nature of the budget has reinforced this as it is largely positive for bonds and negative for equities.\" Lees agrees that it is the right time to reduce risk in equity portfolios, especially as most financial and cyclical companies are on \"quite demanding valuations\". But in a recent statement he did support the likes of Imperial Tobacco, Glaxo and Capita in the large-cap arena, along with \"old favourites\" such as Domino's Pizza and Connaught lower down the market. Lees says they are good examples of companies with resilient earnings growth, strong balance sheets and, in many cases, attractive and growing dividends. More importantly, they lagged the market as it briefly rallied earlier this year. Dermott Whelan of independent financial adviser Informed Choices agrees there is a lot of uncertainty across asset classes and says their recommended portfolio would actually be underweight in gilts. \"We have concerns that demand for gilts will be scarcer this year than it has been over the previous 12 months,\" he says. \"It was the system of quantitative easing that previously bought up much of the gilt issuance and we cannot rely on that to happen again this year, particularly with continued fears about inflation.\" That said, he suggests portfolios should be overweight in index-linked gilts while uncertainty remains about the future of UK inflation. As for equities, Whelan suggests being overweight in European shares. \"We believe that the euro will survive the current crisis, although it may remain weak for some time yet. This would be positive for European exporters, so overseas earnings should help to fund economic growth in Europe, particularly if demand is there from the growth in emerging market economies.\" He remains neutral on UK and American equities but likes the look of Asian (excluding Japan) equities because \"these economies are generating growth well in excess of developed Western economies.\"", "FTSE slides after Moody's threatens to downgrade Spain Shares in London fell to their lowest level in nearly 10 months this morning amid fears that Spain was about to be pulled deeper into the European debt crisis. Last night, rating agency Moody's alarmed the financial markets by announcing that it has put Spain's AAA sovereign rating on review for \"possible downgrade\". It said that the country's economic prospects are deteriorating, at a time when its government is attempting to cut its deficit. Moody's will now evaluate Spain's credit rating again, over the next three months. It said it expects that any cut would only be by \"one, or at most two, notches\". The EBC is calling in \u20ac442bn of loans made a year ago at the height of the financial crisis, so the markets are keen to learn whether institutions now have to lean heavily on its six-day lending facility. Yesterday they borrowed a total of \u20ac131.9bn in 3 months funding, less than feared. According to Gary Jenkins of Evolution Securities, this may be a sign that the banks have lost their appetite for buying government bonds, which they had financed with cheap money from the ECB: A year ago the opportunity to borrow significant sums of money from the ECB at 1% was probably seen by many institutions as an opportunity to put a \"risk free\" trade on where they used the ECB cash to purchase longer dated government bonds and then took the turn. A nice little earner on the face of it. However as we know that has not turned out to be the case and in reality the banks have probably been preparing for the expiry of the \u20ac442bn facility by selling some of the assets that they purchased with it in the first place.", "Ocado flotation fears grow as oil firm's listing heads for collapse Fairfield Energy, a private-equity backed North Sea oil business which was hoping to raise \u00a3330m, has been spurned by investors. A board meeting was taking place tonight and, barring a last-minute rush for the shares, the float is expected to be formally abandoned tomorrow morning. The company, which specialises in extracting hard-to-access oil from mature fields, is expected to blame the current jittery state of global markets and anxiety among potential investors for its decision to pull the float. Ocado, which is aiming for a valuation of more than \u00a31bn, is attempting to raise \u00a3400m from many of the same investors. Ocado shares are being offered in the price range of 200-275p and private investors must get their applications in by midnight on Sunday. Institutional investors have until next Tuesday, but privately, many have made it clear they have no intention of buying shares, insisting the business is worth nowhere near \u00a31bn. Ocado's senior management are currently on a marketing roadshow in the US to persuade American investors to buy shares and its directors are in a blackout period, unable to comment on how the sale process is going. But a source close to the company insisted Fairfield's failure was irrelevant: \"It's an oil well in the North Sea. It is a depleting asset and a finite resource.\" He said the grocer's directors were \"really bored\" with what they believed was negative media coverage and that they remained \"pretty confident\" they would get their float away. Several high-profile City retail analysts have questioned the valuation of the Ocado business. Earlier this week, Clive Black, of Shore Capital, described the price tag as \"stratospheric\". He added: \"It is little short of ludicrous to suggest otherwise\" and is urging investors not to buy the shares \u2013 and to consider shorting them to make money if the price declines. Greg Lawless, of Collins Stewart, believes the shares could be worth just 128p each, while Nick Bubb, of Arden Partners, has suggested the Ocado bosses consider \"a face-saving cut in the price to 160-180p\". A source close to the grocery company said the analysts do not \"get it\" because they are used to assessing the prospects of traditional high street retailers rather than new online business models such as\u00a0Ocado.

New websites gifted.com, mybag.co.uk and washbag.com have been launched in the past three months. The move is a bold departure for the Cheshire-based business, which has grown into Britain's third-largest online DVD and CD retailer in the six years since it was set up by Matthew Moulding and John Gallemore, former executives within John Caudwell's mobile phone empire. By basing much of certain operations in the Channel Islands, the Hut Group exploits a loophole in 27-year-old European tax rules that exempts from VAT any imports below \u00a318 in value arriving from outside the EU. With VAT scheduled to rise from 17.5% to 20% at the end of the year, the appeal of tax-free internet sales is expected to become stronger than ever. The Treasury has been said to be keeping Channel Islands VAT-free trade under \"close review\" and the new government has yet to look at the matter. Data from Kantar market research suggests one in three music CD purchases in the run-up to last Christmas were at VAT-free prices via the internet.

Ocado has never made a bottom-line profit. It took more than 100,000 orders in a single week for the first time during May, with 6% of orders now coming through the Ocado iPhone app. The company, which has just over \u00a3100m of debt, expects to have a \u00a31bn enterprise value at the float. After the share offer, its equity should be valued at \u00a31.1bn. That valuation would be more than double last year's gross sales of \u00a3427m. The bulk of Ocado's customers are inside the M25, although it delivers to towns as far north as Harrogate. It intends to use the bulk of the proceeds of the float to finance a new warehouse and is looking at sites in the Midlands. About \u00a345m will be used to pay down debt. The company said that it had \"a significant market opportunity\" because the grocery sector is the biggest in retail but has the lowest level of online shopping. It added that it had identified growth opportunities for selling non-food ranges \"such as baby [products], health and beauty and kitchenware\" and also saw opportunities to replicate the business overseas. Bracey said: \"We believe now is an ideal time in Ocado's development for it to fund the growth and expansion of the business by raising capital in a flotation.\" He has signed up eight banks to advise on the flotation. Two of them, said Bracey, \"have good research and write well\", while others have been brought in \"to say thank you for stuff they have done in the past\". The float advisers will share fees of about \u00a315m. Ocado's planned float is far from a guaranteed success. SuperGroup \u2013 which owns the Superdry fashion label and retail chain \u2013 floated in March at 500p and today the shares closed up 23p at 733p. However, the rival fashion group New Look was forced to abandon its plans for a float amid gyrating markets and after investors rejected the idea of supplying cash that was to be used largely to repay debt. Philip Dorgan, retail analyst at Ambrian, has described Ocado as \"snake oil\" and said: \"Ocado starts with an 'o', ends with an 'o' and is worth zero.\" Clive Black at Shore Capital said he \"balked\" at the \u00a31bn valuation, which had \"no bearing whatsoever to a sensible earnings multiple ... given ongoing losses [and] micro profits\".", "Battersea power station fires up for London stock market listing Despite numerous plans for the 40-acre site, it has stood empty for more than a quarter of a century while the rest of the Thames waterfront around it has undergone huge change. REO has been hit hard by the Irish property slump. It reported an underlying loss before tax of nearly \u00a31bn for the 14 months to 28 February, reflecting an \u00a3811m drop in the valuation of its property portfolio. The firm has drawn up a shortlist of possible investors after being approached by a number of international real estate groups, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds from around the world, including the Middle East. REO hopes to get permission to redevelop the site in September after submitting the largest ever planning application made in central London, in terms of financial value, last autumn. If it gets the go-ahead, the site's value is expected to soar from the current valuation of \u00a3388m. Treasury Holdings was forced to tear up its plans for the imposing building, one of London's most recognisable landmarks, and start again after Johnson decided that a proposed tower would ruin the view from Waterloo Bridge to the Palace of Westminster. The original plan, drawn up by the New York-based architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, included a futuristic 300m glass funnel and atrium, rising from an enormous transparent dome. Vi\u00f1oly and Treasury Holdings came up with a new blueprint a year ago that is capped at a height of 60m, as stipulated by the mayor. It includes 3,700 homes, office space, shops, restaurants and leisure facilities, at a cost of \u00a34.5bn. Treasury Holdings also hopes to co-fund an extension of London Underground's Northern Line to the site. The high cost means the company needs a partner \u2013 \"someone who can bring big financial strength to it to make sure it happens,\" said Tincknell. Building work could start at the end of 2011. When the power station was decommissioned in 1983, its then owners, the Central Electricity Generating Board, wanted to tear down the building and replace it with housing, but it had been given a Grade II listing in 1980. For developers, the real prize is the land around it; most have little interest in its heritage status.", "Record drop in new US home sales unnerves investors The stock market decline is accelerating after disappointing US new home sales, which fell to a record low and renewed fears that the economy recovery was slowing. After poor existing home sales yesterday, sales of new single family homes fell 32.7% in May to 300,000, the lowest level since the survey started in 1963. Analysts had been expecting a decline of around 14%. Following the expiry of the homebuyer tax credit, May new home sales came in one third lower. At first sight, this is awful. But a marked drop in new home sales was to be expected. New home sales capture deal signings. Deals had to be signed by 30 April to qualify for the homebuyer tax credit. This has pulled forward demand, and caused a demand fallout in May.", "Deepwater oil drilling under scrutiny as Brazil's Petrobas delays flotation Brazil's national oil company Petrobras has surprised investors by postponing its $25bn (\u00a316.86bn) stock market flotation, potentially delaying its efforts to extract oil from deepwater reserves off the coast. The Petrobras stock offering, which had been scheduled for July, will now be delayed by two months until September. It blamed the move on Brazil's ANP energy regulator, which needs more time to assess the value of oil reserves which lie deep below the seabed off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The flotation of Petrobras is a key part of the country's efforts to extract huge quantities of high-quality oil which lie around 280 miles offshore. These reserves are trapped around 4,000 metres under the sea floor, beneath layers of salt and rock. There is also around 2,000 metres of seawater between the seabed and the surface, further complicating the drilling process. Under Petrobras's flotation plan, the government would sell the company the right to extract 5bn barrels of oil in reserves currently under the state's control, and would receive an equal share of the listed company in return. The first of Brazil's massive pre-salt oil fields, Tupi, was discovered in 2007. It contains between 5bn and 8bn barrels of oil, triggering fevered speculation that the country had suddenly become a major player in the world energy market. Other fields have since been discovered, pushing up the total estimates size of the reserves to around 30bn barrels \u2013 roughly the entire world oil consumption in 2010. But environmental activists are deeply concerned that extracting the oil will be dangerous, as it is even deeper than BP's Macondo field. Last week the Global Renewable Fuels Alliance (GRFA) named Brazil's Tupi field as one of the 10 most dangerous offshore sites in the world. \"Drilling through the salt layer will create significant risks,\" the GRFA warned. The Brazilian government is committed to exploiting the pre-salt oil fields. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva wants to use the reserves to cut poverty in the country and improve its education system.", "Online investing and women \"Gone are the days when online investing was completely dominated by men,\" says Edward Croft, chief executive of Stockopedia. \"There are increasing numbers of smart, savvy women out there who are taking up the challenge of making their own investment decisions. \"They are showing that the traditional route of giving full control of your portfolio to an arms-length investment adviser is not the only choice.\" Many of the women who have turned to share trading have done so very recently. Selftrade's figures show that the proportion of investors using its site that are women jumped from 24% to 34% in just two years. The increasing availability of information and share services online has helped fuel this trend. It has also shifted the emphasis away from affluent individuals and City workers. However, as diverse as the investing community may be, many recent investors have taken the plunge because they have been dissatisfied by the performance of their more traditional investments. So, who are the new female investors? Samina is a typical mum of three kids, aged eight, four and two. She is run off her feet and juggles the school run, nursery and childcare, and working four days a week as a debt recovery officer. Samina has always saved. She was prompted to take the plunge into buying and selling shares after her two endowment policies \u2013 with Legal & General and Friends Provident \u2013 performed so badly. \"I just didn't make anything on them. There was no point in doing them. I'm better off self-investing,\" she says. Her disappointment in the performance of her investments came at the same time as she faced problems in her marriage, exacerbating the need for her to exert greater financial control. \"There was a time when I didn't mind someone else investing my money on my behalf, but I've had some issues \u2013 marital problems etc \u2013 so, financially, I need to be secure now. I'm much more conscious of the need to plan ahead and I've realised I need more control over what I'm doing.\" Samina has been encouraged by her stepfather, Zahid, who has bought and sold shares for as long as she can remember, and has provided her with much appreciated guidance. In the past year, Samina's confidence in her own investing ability has grown. Now, instead of just buying and holding shares, she has taken the plunge and sold shares and changed the weighting of her portfolio as the markets have changed. \"At the moment, I'm just invested in UK shares, mainly in power companies and energy providers, but I'm also looking to invest in US markets. \"I could trade a lot more than I do, but if I traded more I'd need to do more research, and I don't have the time for that. I'm doing this to plan for my future, as well, not just for the kids.\" Samina's confidence has grown so much, thanks to the encouragement of Zahid, that she has now become an advocate of investing and has persuaded one of her friends to take up her hobby. \"My friend is the same age \u2013 she's 41 \u2013 with kids the same age. She's a training manager with the civil service, but I've persuaded her, and she now buys shares. The risks are high but it's the best way to make some money grow if you've got the balls for it.\" Kate (not her real name) began investing in shares after her husband died. \"My husband always managed the money. When he died there were all these decisions that I'd never taken that needed sorting. I carried on working and raising the children, and didn't really think about any investments other than to use the Isa allowance as it came up each year.\" The turning point for Kate was when she stopped work seven years ago. \"I just couldn't do the job and raise the kids on my own.\" Suddenly she had more time on her hands and could do the research required to make sensible investment decisions. \"I started off really small. Before, it was someone else always doing that investing and shouldering the risk, either in funds or in Isas, so when I started it suddenly seemed really risky to actually hit that 'buy' button. But I went in gently and read everything I could.\" Kate has researched her investments thoroughly. She began by reading around her subjects. That gave her the material she needed to home in on her specialism \u2013 oil. Kate was looking to invest in something she could hedge against and, for her, that was commodity shortages. Many oil companies may list on the London Stock Exchange and be bought in sterling by UK investors, but they are essentially a dollar-denominated asset, which can remove the sterling risk. \"Once I found my forte, 90% of my active investing has been in oil shares. I'm not talking giants like BP, but small- and medium-sized companies. Their business is simpler to understand than, say, a bank or a pharmaceutical company, because they only have one product, so, as an investor, you're looking to find which company has an edge due to diligence.\" Kate has now returned to work \u2013 for one of Britain's leading charities \u2013 and says her investing takes as much time as she wants it to take. \"I don't run shorts, derivatives or warrants and I don't do spread betting. I just run straight equity positions so I can switch off if I'm on a fortnight's holiday, for example. \"I'm not glued to my PC, but I can do as much, or as little, as I choose.\" Cynthia, who does not want to give her full name, feels she has to do her own investing in order to get any returns, having seen her hard-earned investments reduce in value under the guidance of a broker. Having worked at the United Nationals Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) for 12 years, Cynthia took its \"golden handshake\" payment, worth around \u20ac50,000 (\u00a341,500), and moved to the International Atomic Agency. She left the UN altogether in 2003 and moved to Britain with her husband. As UNIDO was based in Vienna, Cynthia entrusted her \u20ac50,000 to an Austrian broker. Seven years later, her investment is now worth just \u20ac40,000 (\u00a333,200). \"It's really hard to see my money lose so much value, but I feel stuck with it now. If I take that money out, then I've made the loss real. I'd rather keep the \u20ac40,000 where it is in Austria and hope it can make up its shortfall. I feel like I really have no control over that money. Having spent most of her working life outside the UK, Cynthia's investing strategy is strictly global. Her focus is on Brazil, China and emerging markets. \"When I was with UNIDO I travelled a lot through Asia and Brazil, so I know where the opportunities are. For example, Brazil will be hosting the Olympics in 2016, so I'm looking at small- and medium-sized construction companies that I know will benefit from that work. \"I'm also looking in Asia. I'm looking long term at construction, engineering and technology. My mum is from the Philippines, and I've travelled a lot to Asia for work, and this is an area I feel I know. I'm comfortable researching the data and the companies here, and I will have so much more control over my investment choices by buying and selling my own shares than I would if I chose another broker.\" However, Cynthia (above) is not ready to sever all advice ties. She has opted for an advisory online service rather than an \"execution-only\" one because she feels reassured that she can talk through her decisions. \"I can do all my own research and come up with my choices, but then I can double-check, as well, before taking the plunge,\" she says. It won't all be high-risk, small-cap, emerging market companies. Cynthia has also homed in on a couple of blue chip favourites, \"to get a bit more security, for the dividends, and to balance the portfolio\".", "FTSE finishes higher for fifth day but Inmarsat falls out of favour The fall came as Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation from neutral to underperform with a 725p price target, saying it believed the company may have to spend huge amounts of cash to replace its older satellites. The bank said: We are concerned by a number of operational issues, though our primary concern is that Inmarsat could announce a large fleet expansion in order drive top line revenue and fight off competition from the Fixed Satellite Service operators. Instead of the long awaited \"cashflow harvest\" investors had been expecting, shareholders could be hit for up to $1bn to fund new Ka-band satellites. We believe management could use the new long-term revenue guidance due at the second quarter on August 6 to unveil the unpleasant capex news. Based on data in its IPO prospectus, we believe Inmarsat now needs to announce a large fleet renewal as the age of its older generation satellites mean it will need further back-up capacity soon. Of Inmarsat's 11 satellites, four are beyond their original estimated useful lives, three others are due to end in the next two years and one in 2014. We believe Inmarsat is likely to announce a replacement fleet, probably using 3 or 4 new Ka-band satellites at a price of at least $250m each. The company meanwhile maintained Ka-band is only one option, and although expensive, would produce higher revenues. A decision would be made later this year, it said, adding that its performance so far this year had been solid, and it was likely to hit growth expectations. Meanwhile investors are still awaiting news of any possible bid for Inmarsat from its major shareholder Harbinger Capital Partners. BP closed 13.45p lower at 342p, as Fitch downgraded the company in the wake of the escalating costs of the Gulf of Mexico disaster and signs that its rivals had distanced themselves from the company at US Congressional hearings. We remain equal weight on Intercontinental as the outlook is uncertain, although we want to turn more positive as stronger-than-expected recent hotel demand suggests this should be a 'normal' hotel cycle, and we upgrade our 2010 revenue per available room estimate from -2% to +5%. The shares have been ticking lower over recent weeks, reflecting the absence of any positive news flow. That said, we anticipate investors will be severely disappointed in today's news. With the recent trading update indicating a pre-election and volcanic ash driven slowdown we would anticipate investors may discount further trading uncertainty. Bulls of the stock will point to the strong growth delivered in recent years. However, we are entering an unprecedented period of austerity and the company has aggressively been squeezing margins higher. We see significant potential pressure on margins over the short to medium term. We therefore re-iterate our sell recommendation and 170p price target."], "2010-6-B1": ["IG Group shares hit all time high after positive update The company said it expected to report a rise in profits from \u00a3125.9m to \u00a3157m for the year ending May 31, with revenues up 16% to \u00a3298m. The final quarter in particular did well, with revenues up 24%. It said: [IG] has benefited from an increase in volatility in both forex and equity markets in the last few weeks of the year. This volatility boosted client activity and hence revenue, and also increased the rate of new account opening. It remains difficult to predict future trends in volatility or customer reaction to changing market and economic conditions. Strong account opening and the continued development of the offering leave the group well positioned for further growth. The company's shares have climbed 49.3p to 441.5p - up \u00a312.5% - and analyst Robin Savage at Collins Stewart issued a buy note and said: [The profit number] is 3% above the top end of market expectations (\u00a353m to \u00a3126m) and 8% above our forecast. Revenues of \u00a3298m will have surprised most of the market who were expecting between \u00a3294m and \u00a3257m, despite a very clear third quarter IMS in March which showed strong growth. We take this opportunity to increase our 2010 dividend expectation by 11% from 11.7p to 12.9p. The dividend could be even higher: dividend cover of 1.5 times would suggest a total dividend of 20p. This pre-close statement is likely to push IG Group shares to above the all time high of 430p. The final results on 20 July should reveal very strong cash flows and dividend paying capability. We reiterate our 500p target price.", "Phoenix's \u00a3200m restructuring deal paves way for full stock market listing Britain's largest \"zombie\" insurance fund manager, which buys up insurance funds that have been closed to new business, wants to move from a secondary listing to a premium listing to raise its profile and boost its share price. It is also keen to go on a buying spree next year, which will further cut the cost of managing the insurance policies. \"In due course, we believe that we will be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the consolidation of the closed life sector, thereby enhancing value for our shareholders,\" said chief executive Jonathan Moss. The company, the brainchild of pizza and pub entrepreneur Hugh Osmond, has reached a deal to remove contingent share rights that, if approved by investors, will clear the way for the group to obtain a premium listing on 5 July. It expects to be included in the FTSE's UK indices from September. Phoenix announced today that it had agreed to buy out the contingent rights held by two of its main shareholders, by swapping nine shares for every 10 contingent rights. These entitlements promised shares in the business if the share price hit a certain level. They were issued to private equity investors Osmond and Manjit Dale's buyout firm TDR Capital to compensate them for giving up 70% of their stakes in the group as part of a restructuring a year ago, when the firm was in financial trouble and was acquired by an Amsterdam-listed vehicle. At today's London share price of 632.5p, up 7p, the new shares are worth about \u00a3200m and Phoenix is set to have a market value of \u00a31bn following the capital restructuring, up from the current \u00a3840m. Phoenix hopes the premium listing will bring improved liquidity, wider analyst coverage and ultimately a re-rating of the share price, which it believes is undervalued The group has 6.5 million policyholders and \u00a369bn of assets under management. \"If we get this re-rating it will become much easier to think about acquisitions,\" said a spokesman. Analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove welcomed today's deal. \"If passed by shareholders, it will leave a stock with a much simplified capital structure, delivering very strong cash flow.\" They said the likely impact is \"significant share price upside potential, due to a lower share count; and over the medium term, improved liquidity in the shares and, hopefully, a consequent re-rating\".", "Former Vivendi boss Messier admits making 'mistakes' as he faces fraud trial In an uncharacteristic display of contrition, the man who was dubbed \"master of the universe\" by the French media for his arrogance and jet-setting lifestyle, told a panel of judges he recognised that his track record as chief executive of the group until 2002 was not perfect. \"Did we make strategic errors? Yes, undoubtedly. I take responsibility for them,\" said Messier, who embarked on a string of acquisitions to transform an ageing French water company into a multibillion-pound group. \"Certain decisions which I took, which we took collectively, turned out not to have been the best. I certainly made mistakes,\" he told the court. He denies all the charges, which cover a two-year period from 2000, the year of Vivendi's $34bn (\u00a323bn) acquisition of Seagram, the Canadian entertainment and music company. If found guilty, Messier faces up to five years in prison and a fine of \u20ac350,000 (\u00a3292,400). In the latest chapter of the legal saga surrounding the near-implosion of Vivendi, the former Lazard banker is standing trial along with six other executives, including Edgar Bronfman Jr, former vice-chairman, who are accused of criminal activity while at Vivendi. All deny the charges. Unlike a class action suit brought to trial in New York earlier this year, which cleared Messier of wrongdoing but found Vivendi itself liable of misleading investors, the media and telecommunications firm does not figure among the accused in the French trial. In fact it is one of the plaintiffs, together with a group of French investors whose original complaint in 2002 sparked the criminal inquiry into the period the media now refer to as \"les ann\u00e9es Messier\". The Paris court will now have to rule on whether, through his alleged involvement in a move to buy back nearly \u20ac2bn of Vivendi stock after 11 September 2001, Messier was manipulating the share price. It will also have to decide whether what Messier today described as his \"excessive communication\" about the robust state of Vivendi's financial affairs constituted misleading investors. His much-derided \"golden parachute\" of 2002 \u2013 which included \u20ac18.6m severance pay which he subsequently forfeited, and a chauffeur for his wife \u2013 is also up for discussion. D'Huy has said the destruction Messier left in his wake at Vivendi \u2013 including debts of up to \u20ac27bn \u2013 was such that the deal was \"clearly excessive\". Today, at the start of the month-long trial, the business chief insisted he had acted in the \"interest\" of the company and claimed many of the assets bought under his stewardship were now proving some of Vivendi's most profitable.He had, he said, learned one thing throughout the inquiries, which, aside from the two criminal trials, led to him being fined in 2003 and 2004 by French and US financial market regulators. \"You can be proud without being arrogant,\" he told the court. \"At the time, I gave the impression of arrogance, not of pride.\"--ends--"], "2010-5-B2": ["World markets shaky as European debt fears remain Japan's stock market today hit its lowest closing level in more than five months amid ongoing worries over the global implications of the European debt crisis.

The report says that only five FTSE-100 pension funds are in surplus, and predicts that final salary pension schemes at top companies could end within three years. The survey by Pension Capital Strategies in association with investment bank group JP Morgan Cazenove says nine of Britain's biggest listed companies face pension liabilities greater than their stock market value \u2013 a situation which PCS says \"represents a material risk to the business\". The survey also reveals that pension funds missed out on the benefit of soaring equity markets in the year to the end of March, because they have continued to switch their investments into bonds. Three years ago the average pension scheme allocated 34% to bonds, but this has now risen to 50%. PCS says that with cash in short supply it expects pension trustees to be increasingly open to approaches to deficit funding. Instead of cash, they could be persuaded to take other assets. Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer, for instance, have recently announced property partnership deals with their schemes worth a total of more than \u00a31bn towards reducing their deficits. While deficit funding is up, there has been a marked decline in the provision of defined benefit pensions to staff. The costs linked to continuing provision fell 15% last year \u2013 \"one of the clearest signs yet that we are coming to the end of the road for final salary schemes\", said Charles Cowling, managing director of PCS. He predicted that final salary schemes could be extinct in big companies by 2013: \"If reductions continue at this rate, final salary schemes will have six years left of life; if the trend accelerates, which is likely given recent announcements of pension scheme closures, then the lifespan of the final salary scheme may be as little as two to three years.\" The costs of running final salary schemes have risen dramatically in recent years as a result of tax changes, low interest rates, poor investment returns and increasing life expectancy. The five companies with the best funded schemes, and which still have surpluses, are Old Mutual, Prudential, Investec, Land Securities and the London Stock Exchange", "FTSE falls 3% on German shorting ban, while Home Retail struggles On another volatile day for the stock market thanks to Germany's surprise ban on short selling European debt, one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 was suffering because of more domestic concerns. The stock has been supported recently by share buybacks and M&A hopes. While acquiring Argos would fulfil the ambitions of certain food retailers, we note that a competition commission reference would be almost certain, separating Argos and Homebase may be costly, and that two of the big four UK grocers have new CEOs. On trading, Hughes added: Earnings risks are rising, with the new government possibly tightening fiscal policy more rapidly than expected. VAT may rise sooner, and sterling has continued to decline versus the dollar. The first quarter may start off slowly with more competition in electricals, and cooler weather affecting Homebase. Best Buy may only have one store but its website pricing in the autumn is likely to be very aggressive. We estimate Argos a 5% fall in first quarter like for like sales. For the full year we now assume a 2% like for like fall from a 1% decline as second half catch-up may be harder. This gives a \u00a310m downgrade. Homebase is still based on +1% full year like for like sales, with broadly flat earnings befolre interest and tax. In such a febrile market rumours were rife, including unsubstantiated talk that the European Central Bank was ready to intervene to support the euro and even speculation - immediately denied - that Greece was about to leave the single currency. Among the UK banks, we are wary of Barclays. It has meaningful retail and corporate operations in Spain (although it is unknown what exact proportion of the group this comprises) and an undisclosed ownership of Spanish sovereign debt. The company will likely make acquisitions during the year and the bid pipeline is stronger than at the beginning of the calendar year. But the company will continue to pay out excess cash to shareholders going forward - so this buyback scheme could be ongoing. In a buy note on Experian UBS said: We still find the valuation attractive relative to slower growing peer Equifax, historical valuation levels, our fundamental discounted cash flow valuation, and given what is now a more compelling cash return story. We continue to view improvement in core US credit operations as a key fundamental driver over the coming 12 months. At the time of the IPO [in 2007], Blinkx talked about the potential to launch transaction hijacking software. This is software that recognizes when users are about to buy something online and, before a sale is completed, displays options for purchasing the same good from rival retailers at a cheaper price. This software, branded 'cheep', is currently in closed beta and should be released to the public in the the second half of 2010. This presents a potential opportunity for Blinkx to enter the very dynamic affiliate marketing/price comparison market.

Despite weeks of market volatility, Jupiter's management and US buyout house TA Associates are pressing ahead with flotation plans that could value the business at up to \u00a31bn. The move follows a string of aborted or stalled new issues, including New Look, Merlin Entertainments and hotel bookings firm Travelport. Share sales and the issue of new shares would see management reduce its equity share holdings from 80% to about 50%. New investors are expected to take up a free float of about 30% with TA acquiring shares to keep its holding steady at 20% for the first six months. The majority of the \u00a3220m proceeds from the issue of new shares will go to repay shareholder-owned debt. About 80% of these preference securities are held by TA, with the balance controlled by a small number of senior figures at Jupiter. Top fund managers such as Tony Nutt and Philip Gibbs as well as directors have agreed to a three-year phased lock-in and vesting period for before further share sales. The capital-raising is not expected significantly to reduce the group's net bank debt which management believe is already at a comfortable level given Jupiter's high cash generation. Net debt at float is expected to be about \u00a3150m. Float plans come three years after Bonham Carter led a buyout from Commerzbank in the summer of 2007, just weeks before the credit crunch brought an abrupt end to large debt-fuelled private equity deals. It was one of the last buyout transactions to secure so-called \"covenant-lite\" terms. Jupiter, meanwhile, has weathered the credit crunch rather better despite having a strong focus on the British stock market. It has even lured back some fund managers who had gone to New Star. Gibbs became a hero for many investors after his Financial Opportunities fund returned 7% in 2008. Identifying trouble ahead for the banks, in November 2007 he placed half the fund in cash and bonds and invested heavily outside Britain, benefiting from the weakening pound.", "Glencore considers flotation on London stock market to raise \u00a34bn   Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader, is to raise up to \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) in one of the biggest flotations on the London stock market, according to City sources. Analysts value the company at \u20ac45bn. Proceeds from a flotation will be used to expand the mining side of Glencore's business, with the Swiss-based company looking at acquisitions in Brazil, Australia and South Africa. Glencore took the first step towards becoming a public company recently by issuing up to $2.2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in convertible bonds to strategic investors in the US, Singapore and China. \"The mix of investors is typical of what you would expect in a pre-initial public offering\", a commodities banker said. Glencore said that the bonds were convertible \"into Glencore shares upon a qualifying IPO or upon other pre-determined qualifying events\". A flotation is pencilled in for 2011, but could come earlier if the economic recovery gathers steam and prices continue their upward trajectory. Glencore's increasing openness further moves it away from its roots under Marc Rich, the oil trader who founded Glencore in 1974 but later sold out to management. In 1983, Rudolph Giuliani, then a US prosecutor, indicted Rich for tax evasion and he became a fugitive in Switzerland. On leaving office in 2001, President Bill Clinton pardoned Rich. Some observers suggest preparation for a flotation is the precursor to a merger with Xstrata [see footnote], which could create a natural resources group valued at more than $50bn. Sources say that the merger option is the preferred route for Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive, and there have been reports that executives have met Xstrata shareholders. A merger of Glencore and Xstrata is being seen as the best way for Glencore to go public, because the companies are connected. Glencore owns a significant number of Xstrata shares. Willy Strothotte is chairman of both companies. And Glencore was instrumental in creating Xstrata: in 2001 it sold coal assets to the then-fledgling mining company and those assets became Xstrata's bedrock for its 2002 flotation. \"Glasenberg would love to have all the mining assets and the trading assets combined under one roof,\" said an executive familiar with Glencore's thinking. Xstrata boss Mick Davis could be receptive. He built his company through a string of acquisitions, but his boldest bid \u2013 to merge Xstrata with Anglo American \u2013 failed last year. In a recent speech Davis reiterated Xstrata's \"commitment to scale and diversity as key sources of advantage in an increasingly globalising and consolidating mining industry.\" But agreeing a valuation of Glencore with Xstrata investors could prove tricky and may force Glencore to float first before considering anything else. An extra benefit of such a move, say observers, would be that it would force the trader to adapt to an independent board and other aspects of public corporate governance. This could lessen the culture shock of merging with a FTSE 100 company. Glencore is seeking a flotation because, as a private company led by a partnership, its growth options are few. Relying on the bond markets limits its ability to make big acquisitions. If it could raise equity on the stock market, the company could expand more rapidly and take much bigger strides along the way. It is thought that Glencore is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, while Xstrata has retained Goldman Sachs [see footnote]."], "2010-8-B2": ["US investors win right to challenge runaway boardroom pay packets Investors have won enhanced powers to challenge runaway pay packets and poor management at the top of the US business world under contentious rules approved today that make it easier for shareholders to unseat directors of Wall Street-listed companies. In an outcome cheered by unions but vehemently opposed by business lobbyists, the securities and exchange commission voted by a narrow margin of 3-2 to allow investors holding more than 3% of a company's stock to put their own nominees for boardroom seats on election ballots sent out in advance of annual meetings. The change amounts to a historic shift in the balance of power in the US corporate world, where shareholders have traditionally had only very limited sway over the direction of companies. \"As a matter of fairness and accountability, long-term significant shareholders should have a means of nominating candidates to the boards of the companies they own,\" said the SEC's chairman, Mary Schapiro, who described the change as one of the most contentious issues ever addressed by her agency. To date, investors who want to nominate board members have had to finance their own proxy battles and pay for mailshots to shareholders \u2013 an expensive and cumbersome process that only well-resourced fund management firms or activist billionaires have been able to afford. An umbrella organisation of US unions, the AFL-CIO, applauded the greater access afforded by the provision, which is likely to be used to challenge multimillion-dollar boardroom bonuses. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, described it as \"an important and historic step in empowering long-term investors\". Not everybody, however, is pleased. Business leaders portray it as an unwelcome distraction, arguing that it will force companies to devote valuable time and resources at the height of an economic slowdown to challenges brought by special interest groups. David Hirschmann, head of capital markets competitiveness at the US Chamber of Commerce, described it as \"a giant step backwards\" for average investors: \"Using the proxy process to give labour union pension funds and others greater leverage to try to ram through their agenda makes no sense.\"", "Shareholder trading values Facebook at more than $33bn Facebook is now being valued at more than $33bn (\u00a321.3bn) as investors try to secure a stake in the social networking site in anticipation of its flotation on the US stock market. The latest data shows that shares in Facebook are changing hands for up to $76 each, more than double their value at the start of this year. While Facebook is still privately held, shareholders are able to sell the company's stock through \"secondary market\" trading. By buying at these prices, some investors are calculating that Facebook is worth more than eBay or Dell, or nearly twice as much as Yahoo!. Secondary market trading can artificially inflate the value of a private company, as the relative scarcity of its shares may encourage a buyer to overpay. But with founder Mark Zuckerberg thought to be planning to float Facebook in the next couple of years, there is already strong interest in what would be the tech sector's biggest IPO since Google went public six years ago. Technology and internet companies tend to be valued on relatively high \"multiples\" \u2013 the ratio of their market capitalisation to their annual earnings. Apple, for example, was worth $219bn when Wall Street closed last night and is expected to deliver profits of nearly $13bn in 2010. That gives Apple a price-to-earnings ratio of around 17x based on this year's performance. Yahoo has a p/e ratio of almost 22x, while Google's p/e ratio is 19.5x. It is also benefiting from the smartphone boom \u2013 communications regulator Ofcom reported last week that 45% of all mobile internet use in the UK was spent on Facebook. However, it has repeatedly faced criticism over privacy issues, and users may resist efforts to \"mine\" their personal information so it can be used to drive revenue growth. In 2007, Facebook sold a 1.6% stake to Microsoft for $240m, a deal that valued the whole social networking firm at $15bn. This was after Zuckerberg had rejected a $1bn takeover offer from Yahoo!. He also reportedly rebuffed Microsoft's efforts to buy the whole company. An IPO might not happen until 2012, and some technology analysts believe there is still time for Zuckerberg to receive an offer he cannot refuse. \"Microsoft could used Facebook as a portal for all their cloud services. They could include MS Office, and a prominent Bing search box,\" Holway suggested. \"Apple popularised the app, and Facebook is the most used app of all. Both Facebook and Apple apps bypass Google main revenue stream \u2013 sponsored search. Google is the company with the most to fear right now.\" (market capitalisation based on last night's closing prices)", "Markets shaken by weakness of US goods orders Financial markets were spooked again today by US double-dip fears as orders for durable goods were weaker than expected and American companies appeared to cut back investment sharply. Stocks opened lower on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 extended its losses, oil prices fell and the dollar weakened as the US government said new orders for durable goods such as cars, machinery and household appliances rose a meagre 0.3% last month. This was much lower than the 2.8% rise forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Excluding equipment for the transport sector \u2013 seen as particularly volatile \u2013 orders fell 3.8%, the biggest drop for 18\u00a0months, and confounded expectations for a modest 0.5% rise. Rob Carnell at ING Financial Markets said the durable goods numbers \"throw more doubt on the resilience of the US recovery\" and that business investment growth was likely to slow in the third quarter, \"which will cost around 1 percentage point of GDP growth, and keep fears of a double dip and more quantitative easing on investors minds\". Aneta Markowska at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale painted a similar outlook: \"After strong business investment figures in the second quarter which look on track to be revised up, we are likely to see a significant loss of momentum in the second half of the year. Durable data reaffirms the recent weakness in regional manufacturing surveys and suggests that the resiliency in industrial production figures is unlikely to last.\" The data follows news yesterday that US home sales slumped twice as fast as expected last month, to hit a 15-year low. Those figures rattled stock markets in the US and Europe, and government bonds rallied as investors sought out safe-haven investments. Today the FTSE 100 was down more than 1.2%, or 64 points, at 5091.5, extending losses of about 50 points before the durable goods data. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped about 30 points, or 0.3%, to 10009 at the opening bell on Wall Street, putting it on track for the fifth straight session of losses. On UK government bond markets, yields on 10-year gilts set a fresh record low of 2.79%. Traders will have more to go on at 3pm in the UK when US new home sales data is published.", "Fears grow of double-dip slump after US home sales plummet Fears intensified yesterday that the US was heading for a double dip recession that could reverberate around the world after figures showed American home sales slumped twice as fast as expected last month to a 15-year low. The main New York stock market fell through the psychologically important 10,000 level and the London exchange was also down sharply as global markets were rattled by news that sales of previously owned US homes dropped by a record 27% last month. Oil prices went into reverse and commodities declined as traders digested the news that the world's largest economy was a long way from recovery and could slip back into recession. The July drop dwarfed predictions of a 13% fall in sales expected following the withdrawal of a housebuying tax credit introduced last year to boost sales. Analysts said they would look closely at a speech later this week by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, who is expected to comment on prospects for the economy and the need for further government action to stimulate growth. Pressure on the Obama administration to adopt further measures to boost the economy are expected to intensify in the run-up to mid-term congressional elections in November. Ireland, Portugal and Spain also saw their borrowing costs jump.Martin Weale, the most recent government appointee to the Bank of England monetary policy committee, said in an interview with the Times that there was a risk of a double dip recession in the UK. He said the weakness of the recovery meant the economy could falter and anyone who ruled out the possibility of a return to negative growth was \"foolish\". Austerity measures will be outlined by the coalition government after the comprehensive spending review in October, which will outline how ministers plan to cut between 25% and 40% from Whitehall spending over the next five years. Concerns that Europe will follow the US back into recession also gained ground after Greek bond yields, which govern the interest rate paid by the government on its borrowing, spiralled to 11.3%. US economist Joseph Stiglitz said European governments were manufacturing a return to recession with cuts in areas that would spur recovery. He said a determination to limit government borrowing to 3% of national income was \"bizarre\". The Columbia University professor told Irish radio: \"Cutting back willy-nilly on high-return investments just to make the picture of the deficit look better is really foolish. \"Because so many in Europe are focusing on the 3% artificial number, which has no reality and is just looking at one side of a balance sheet, Europe is at risk of going into a double-dip.\" On the foreign exchange markets the dollar fell against most other major currencies although it was still up against the pound which was hit by Weale and Stiglitz's double-dip comments. Their warnings and fears about the US economy left investors flocking to the safe-haven of bonds. Yields on 10-year gilts in the UK were at a record low of 2.88%. Nick Beecroft, senior markets consultant at Saxo Bank, described the session as the \"day the 'Sum of all Fears' took root in the mind of the market\". He said: \"Fears about growth in Europe, Asia and the US, where calamitous existing home sales figures were the focus \u2026 Deflation, the strength of the yen, the lingering euro zone sovereign debt problem \u2013 you name it, the market has a frightening selection of fears from which to choose.\" Richard Batty, investment director at Standard Life, said the US housing market data was \"shocking\" and showed almost nobody wanted to buy a home. The US is being closely watched for signals of troubles to come in the UK as it typically leads other economies by several months. Recent downbeat news on the US has ranged from signs that unemployment remains stubbornly high to weak activity across most business sectors. Teunis Brosens at ING Financial Markets described the July home sales reading as a headlong plunge. \"These are truly dismal numbers, adding to the recent flurry of data suggesting that the recovery of the US economy is faltering,\" he said. . He pointed out that some of the fall was down to the expiry of a government scheme that had \"artificially propped up\" the market over the past year. While on paper the US housing market makes up a smaller part of the economy following the crash, new signs of stagnation are likely to dent consumer confidence. That coupled with the prospect of deflation will hit spending, economists warn. \"The hard-pressed western consumer, already fearful over employment prospects and desperately trying to rebuild their balance sheet, will be the first to delay discretionary purchases of every kind if they feel they will be cheaper in a year's time,\" said Saxo Bank's Beecroft.", "Investments head east as major markets stagnate The Jakarta Composite Index had a relatively quiet day, climbing 11.01 points, or 0.4%, to close at 3,128. But a year ago the index was worth almost a third less at 2,235. By comparison the FTSE 100 has done little more than provide day traders with mild heart failure. An index that languished at 4,800 last September moved up to 5,800 before the election only to dive again to 4,800. Today it finished up slightly at 5,234. Markets in Japan and New York have followed much the same sideways path. So what do the smaller far eastern markets have that we don't? Could it be the sparkling narrative from investment banks about a bright future built on commodities such as coal, zinc, tin and copper. Surely not when most commodities have failed to regain their April highs and slowing Chinese growth is already reversing. It must be that these markets have gained simply because they hold the promise of gains away from stagnating western markets. The vast savings of companies and wealthy individuals sloshing around the global financial system, which runs to trillions of pounds, is constantly looking for a home. It wants the highest returns. At the moment Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are among the lucky recipients. Lucky that is until someone points out share values are over inflated and bear little relation to future profits. As more money flows into markets the index rises, when investors take fright and move their money out, the indexes will collapse. For the time being, these countries will talk about their economic miracle and what great places they are for investors, but it won't last. A bubble is a bubble and before long it will burst. Brazil is talked about as the next beneficiary/victim of investor cash. It largely escaped the financial crisis and is growing strongly on the back of exports to the west. The risk comes when financial advisers identify the country as the \"next big thing\" and the hot money flows out of Indonesia in favour of Sau Paulo. All these countries should be wary of providing a home for investor cash when it is fickle and in the main without allegiance or scruple. Like a teen lover, it is always on the lookout for the next conquest.", "City boy for a day: I was at a loss Will de Lucy and Piers Curran are the founders of Amplify, a trading house which also trains students to become traders themselves. Their hope is that graduates, older workers and even those made redundant during the recession will see trading as a chance to begin or re-launch their stuttering careers. The company offers training and internships, lasting for up to four months, which can lead to a longer-term career with Amplify, or simply help students develop a career in banking and finance. Students learn and trade using a\u00a0simulated platform; if they are in profit or have not lost money on the pretend account at the end of their training, Amplify will back them with its own funds in the live markets, increasing their size and market exposure as they improve. Those who do not stay on will leave with industry-recognised professional certificates. This year, Amplify will take on about 165 trainees, while the investment banking sector as a whole has so far taken on 2,200 graduates in 2010. I enter a training room with three other journalists. We're chucked in at the deep end, bombarded with information about candlestick charts, S&P500 futures contracts, oil, the euro debt crisis, the double-dip recession and U-shaped curves. Shorting is when you sell an asset, going long is when you buy it. I\u00a0switch off while Curran explains something about the reasons for the euro collapsing; instead, I begin to wonder if his suit is tailored and, if it is, how many pork bellies it would take to buy one. We are told that it takes 0.05 seconds for a trade to go live from the moment you click buy or sell. That's how quickly fortunes are made or lost. \"The software needs to be fast because you need to be able to react,\" De\u00a0Lucy explains. Later, I will see just how fast the market moves as I watch, aghast, at my mounting losses. Psychology is key. Beginners often want to exit a trade the second they achieve a decent profit, regardless of whether it's the right time or not. They do not have the confidence to stay in the market even when the signs are telling them to because they are terrified the gains they have already made could be wiped out. Similarly, if they lose money one day, they must retain their objectivity the next so that they do not begin making irrational decisions in order to recover their losses. \"It's a marathon, not a sprint,\" warns De Lucy. Our brief lesson over, we are given three asset classes to trade with using the simulator: oil, the S&P500 and the euro/dollar. Within 15 minutes I'm down $200 (\u00a3128), mainly from trading oil. Three minutes later I turn that into a $35 profit and am staggered at how quickly money can be made or lost. After 20 minutes my profit has edged up to $47.50, but is wiped out just 60 seconds later when a\u00a0bad oil short sends me $25 into the red. I begin to fall into one of the psychological traps we had been warned about. Whenever I see profit stretching above $100, my right-hand immediately reaches for the mouse and I hurriedly click \"sell\" to bank the gain, not having the confidence to back my positions for more than a minute or two. But it's a strategy that pays immediate dividends. After half an hour of trading I have a\u00a0profit of $157.50; after 45 minutes it's $477.50 and after an hour $967.50. This is easy, I think. But it soon becomes clear that my strategy is not based on market data, studious analysis of charts or behavioural finance \u2013 I am simply guessing. For the first hour, I guess correctly and patiently build my profits. It takes just two minutes to see it all wiped out by a disastrous decision; I gamble on the oil price continuing to rise just as it collapses. A red arrow blips repeatedly on my screen, numbers tumble down it, and my profit quickly morphs into a loss of $182. We put our headsets on and listen to Curran talking to Amplify traders around the world, telling them what they should be looking out for, where the levels of support or resistance are across the indices and asset classes they trade. His disciples in Spain, Hong Kong, New York and elsewhere respond in a live chat window with messages such as, \"if the euro continues to climb, yes oil can go higher\". All have passed through the London offices, most as trainees. The trainees pay \u00a31,500 for two months of training but only two or three out of 10 trainees stay with the company \u2013 the ones who display consistently good risk management. The lucky few get to keep 60% of their profits, while their losses are covered by Amplify. A newbie will be able to buy or sell just one contract a trade and will be set their own stop/loss level to ensure they can only lose a maximum of about $225 in any day. Within six months they will be given more responsibility and larger sums to play with. Given the risk controls placed on new traders, De Lucy says they can expect to earn between \u00a32,000 and 3,000 by the third or fourth month: \"If you're any good, you'll always be profitable at the end of each week.\" So who is best-placed to become a trader? Curran had an engineering degree when he began his career in finance more than a decade ago, while De Lucy had a degree in economics, something he says he rarely uses today. \"The course is intense, so a background in finance is useful, but other degrees aren't a problem,\" De Lucy explains. He says good traders tend to have an entrepreneurial streak: \"This is because they alone have to take responsibility for their decisions. Also, although trading itself can be very rewarding, people who need to know they have certainty and security can feel uncomfortable in this environment and this can be reflected in reduced confidence and poor-decision making in the markets.\" Around one in 15 applicants applies to Amplify looking for a career change, though most of these older applicants are usually already working somewhere in the finance industry. \"Funnily enough, they tend to be among those who don't stay on after their training,\" De Lucy says. He looks over my shoulder at the computer screen and casually says that, judging by the amount of oil trades I am making, it looks like I have an \"itchy trigger finger\". A lot of new traders \"get killed\" on oil, because the price moves around a lot, he adds ominously. Each time I make a loss I feel a bit stupid and my head is filled with imagery of Depression-era bankers leaping to their doom from the roofs of Wall Street. When I make money, my confidence grows and I'm transformed into a fist-pumping, pinstripe-wearing City boy. It's exhausting. But the truth is, making money anonymously like this, with no end product except profit or loss, just doesn't motivate me. It's addictive, yes, but only in the way a computer game like Tetris might divert you for 20 minutes. Perhaps this is because I am merely playing at being a trader rather than putting expert knowledge to use. The depth of knowledge required is evident when Curran shows us a graph of Barack Obama's latest popularity rating, something I had thought would be of more interest to those involved in politics. I was wrong. Each time the president's popularity poll is updated, markets can move because of what he might do in response to regain his popularity among the American public, such as a tax-break or some kind of improved fiscal stimulus that might result in job creation and consumers returning to the shops. This in turn might stimulate economic growth and boost equity and oil prices. \"The US consumer has a Pavlovian response to more money in their pockets and that is to head to the shops,\" De\u00a0Lucy says. Then there's the behavioural finance, weather patterns, macro-economics, geo-political tensions. It all gets fed into a trader's head and is processed to inform every buy/sell decision. Analyse badly and you lose money. Analyse well and you make money. \"You need to be a\u00a0jack of all trades,\" says Curran. In the Amplify office, all this is happening at a frightening rate, with televisions blaring out financial news, traders' voices coming through headsets, numbers and ideas and comments and suggestions scrolling relentlessly across traders' screens. I find it all stressful and begin to lose confidence as I tire. \"If someone isn't confident, they can begin to second-guess themselves,\" De Lucy says. \"We call it 'trader killer', when they can't get over their fear and every decision is polluted by sentiment.\" Almost all new traders see a 70% dip in performance when they go from the simulation to live trading and also when they have their trading size increased. If anything were to make me want to work at Amplify long-term, it would be the people. De Lucy and Curran are likeable guys. I see De Lucy comforting and motivating a young intern who is tentatively entering the market the day after making heavy losses. He cuts through any sentiment and attempts to bring the trainee back to the basics of what he has learned and to have confidence in what he knows. It is nothing like the cut-throat, alpha-male posturing I would have expected from a City trading firm. Ironically, only a couple of journalists celebrate their trading wins with loud cries of victory. As I pose for a photographer and pretend to win outrageously on the stock market, I realise that, despite all the analysis, knowledge and training, trading is still a little like gambling, with the traders trying to stack the odds in their favour using any piece of information they can get their hands on. If it wasn't like gambling, there would be no Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, no Long-Term Capital Management bail-out, no credit crunch in 2007. How did I get on? At the end of the day, I made a profit of $580, but De Lucy tells me I made far too many trades in oil (about 170) and the trading fees have consequently turned my profit into a loss of $233. I was praised for a single trade on the S&P because I held my position for almost two hours. \"Really nice patience there, which is uncommon for a new trader,\" he says. \"It's a shame you were addicted to oil.\" It's clear that a trading career is not for me, but there is nothing to stop people interested in finance signing up. Even financiers who over-stretched themselves in the run-up to 2007 might learn a lot \u2013 though De Lucy and Curran might want to keep them on the simulator for longer than usual.", "Ocado's going cheap, say analysts \u2013 but not that cheap Funnily enough, everyone seems to the think are shares are cheap at the current price of 142p. Goldman Sachs thinks they are worth 200p and HSBC opts for 190p. UBS's analyst comes the closest to stepping out of line by declaring fair value at 167p, or 13p below the eventual float price. Hold on. Wasn't Ocado's original ambition to sell shares in a 200p-275p range? Indeed it was. Surely there must be an analyst out there prepared to venture towards the mid-point of that range? If not, the original valuation range would look even crazier than it did at the time. Don't be shy, the reputations of your investment banking colleagues on the other side of the Chinese walls are at stake.", "Lacklustre stock markets halt autumn floats   An array of rumoured flotations that were delayed during the financial crisis but tipped for revival this autumn have been shelved again on fears about the state of the capital markets. Goldman Sachs, the banker to Betfair and Virgin Active, has been talking up the prospects of both businesses floating this autumn, but advisers to the gym operator confirmed there was little chance of it seeking a listing this year. Sources close to Betfair suggested market conditions might also scupper the online betting exchange floating this autumn \u2013 a much-heralded \u00a31.5bn float that would also be complicated by the fact that it would probably crystallise large losses for Softbank, the Japanese investor which has a 23% stake in the gambling business. Another Apax-owned business, the bureau de change group Travelex, was also reportedly considering tapping the equity markets this year, but it too plays down becoming a public company during 2010. Meanwhile, Blackstone-owned travel reservations company Travelport, which cancelled its \u00a31.8bn flotation in February, said last month it had \"no compunction to list\". Equity analysts will also be watching closely for worsening economic news that could further undermine any remaining flotation plans over the next few weeks. \"US third quarter GDP numbers are set to be announced later this month. That number could conceivably be negative, which would set the cat amongst the pigeons,\" said one.", "World markets fall on economic fears Fears over the health of the global economy sent shares falling sharply around the world this morning. The sell-off was most pronounced in Japan, where a \u00a36.9bn stimulus package announced yesterday by the Japanese government failed to impress investors. The Nikkei index shed more than 3.6% in a nervy trading session to close at 8824.06 points, its lowest level since April last year. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 70 points in early trading to a low of 5129.66, down 1.3%. There were also losses in other European markets, with the German DAX losing 1.1% and the French CAC down by 0.9%. The threat of a double-dip recession also continues to loom, according to Ben Potter, market strategist at IG Markets. \"There's the idea that any rampant growth we're seeing now is merely going to end up as being the peak between two recessionary troughs,\" Potter warned. There was also concern that US personal incomes rose by just 0.2% last month, less than expected. David Buik of BGC Partners said this had \"added credence to the thought process that the US economy is losing momentum and is wilting under pressure\". Yesterday the Bank of Japan announced new measures to encourage Japanese banks to lend to each other. This was swiftly followed by a \u00a5900bn ($6.9bn) stimulus package, but this was denounced as too timid to address Japan's problems. The yen is hovering around a 15-year high against the dollar, hurting the country's exporters.", "US new house sales hit record low The FTSE 100 sank to a seven-week low last night as fresh gloom from the US raised the prospect of recession gripping the global economy once again. A record low for sales of new US homes combined with news of stuttering orders for manufacturers to underline fears that the world's largest economy could be heading for a double-dip downturn. Speculation grew that central bankers will be forced to step in with fresh support for the fledgling recovery as the US government said new orders for durable goods such as cars, machinery and household appliances rose a meagre 0.3% last month. That was well below the 2.8% rise forecast by analysts. Stocks opened lower on Wall Street, oil prices fell and the dollar weakened after the data. Shares remained in the red as separate data followed showing new single family home sales slid 12.4% in July to a 276,000 annual rate. That was the lowest since records began in 1963 and confounded expectations for the pace to hold steady. With investors fretting about knock-on effects globally following a series of downbeat US indicators, the FTSE 100 ended down 46.6 points, or 0.9%, at 5109.4, the lowest close since early July. Yields on 10-year UK government bonds set a fresh record low of 2.79% as US jitters continued to fuel a rush for safe-haven assets. \"The US housing market is imploding alongside its economy; poor manufacturing, retail and activity surveys have stripped away the veneer of an American recovery and the market has realised that the emperor is not wearing any clothes,\" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist, currency exchange broker World First. \"As a result, 'haven' assets such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc are powering to record highs and the yield on government debt is tumbling as investors continue their flight to quality.\" Economists raised particular concerns over signs in the orders data that investment by US companies was stalling and so was unlikely to provide support to the wider economy. Orders for capital goods unexpectedly slumped 8%, excluding the defence sector and aircraft. Rob Carnell, at ING Financial Markets, predicted that business investment growth would slow in the third quarter, \"which will cost around 1 percentage point of GDP growth, and keep fears of a double dip and more quantitative easing on investors' minds\". It was the prospect of more support from central bankers in the form of quantitative easing (QE) or fresh government stimulus packages that helped to contain losses on US stock markets. After an initial drop on Wall Street that saw the Dow Jones industrial average topple through the psychologically important 10,000 mark, shares regained some poise by the time London closed. With mid-term congressional elections in November, pressure is mounting on the Obama administration to adopt further measures to boost the economy. For investors, the recent flow of weak figures has also increased the prospect of the US central bank embarking on more QE - a system whereby it buys securities in the market and thereby pumps electronic money into the economy. Markets will be scouring a speech on Friday by Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, for any hints. The US Federal Reserve's policy committee under the leadership of Bernanke has reportedly become increasingly split over how much more support is needed and when. The picture will become clearer when the Federal Open Market committee publishes the minutes from its latest meeting next week. According to the Wall Street Journal, the gathering was \"among the most contentious\" in Bernanke's four-and-a-half year tenure as Fed chairman. The newspaper described divisions over the technical issue of how the Fed manages the portfolio of securities that has built up during its QE spree. At the same time there was a more fundamental debate over what action to take next over the spluttering recovery and weak inflation. At the 10 August meeting, the Fed took a cautious step towards pumping extra liquidity into the financial system through an operation described as \"QE lite\". It decided to reinvest the proceeds of its maturing holdings of mortgage-backed securities by putting the funds into Treasury bonds. But many economists believe the move will be followed by more full-blown QE before the end of the year."], "2010-8-B1": ["Safe investments to beat inflation Bank of England governor Mervyn King this week warned that the level of inflation will remain above the 2% target for much of next year and, possibly, into 2012. But what can savers do to protect their cash? Until recently, billions of pounds was pouring into National Savings & Investments' index-linked bonds, but these have been withdrawn from sale. Many in the City believe that inflation will indeed fall back in 2012, although others worry that \"quantitative easing\" is creating a timebomb. The man charged with picking investments for the Queen's own stockbroker, Marcus Brookes of Cazenove Capital, is focused, above all else, on protecting his clients from this problem. He puts it bluntly: \"As an investor, if you get this one wrong you could be toast. If you are on the wrong side of the debate you will lose 15% to 20% of the real value of your capital in a very short time, ie, you don't protect yourself from inflation.\" But there is now a way to buy them from as little as \u00a31 through an exchange-traded fund. ETFs are effectively shares which trade on the stockmarket and can be purchased through a stockbroker. They promise to match almost perfectly the price of government-issued, inflation-linked bonds and are seen as very safe. That is because the bank which creates the fund physically buys a sum of the bonds, equal to the value of the fund, and holds them for security. They can be bought and sold easily and have only a minimal annual management charge. The downside is that the ETF does not enjoy the special income tax treatment National Savings & Investment products did, but then nothing else does, either. They can be held within a tax-efficient Isa. However, you should check carefully whether the company selling the Isa, and buying the ETF, charges extra fees. While the ETF will match inflation, many people would like to be confident of beating inflation but would also be willing to take a bit more risk to gain a higher return. One way to do this is to invest not just in bonds issued by the government, but also in bonds issued by companies, known as corporate bonds. These carry the risk that if the companies issuing the bonds go bust, the investor could lose all his money.", "Investing: Healthy profits highlight depth of last year's turmoil Recession, what recession? That could be the question investors are asking themselves as they study the latest set of half-year results from some of our largest companies. So does this mean we can look forward to a resumption of economic growth and, with it, a return to confidence in the anaemic stock market? Alas, probably not. The healthy profits say far more about how awful the economic outlook was this time last year than about where we will be in another 12 months. Then it looked as if we were poised for a full-blown depression and companies reacted accordingly, cutting costs and closing peripheral activities. Now that disaster has been avoided \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 the effect of the cuts has been to boost profits dramatically. But that can only happen once; companies now need a real recovery to keep profits growing, and the chances of that look slim. The banks are no more excited about prospects. Given the scale of the write-offs which they all made against bad debts last year, it would have been astonishing if their profits in the first half of the year had not rebounded sharply. But given the plethora of regulatory inquires into everything from how they pay their counter staff, through lending levels to small businesses, to whether the investment and retail banking activities should be separated, there are plenty of clouds on their horizon. \"[Profit] margins have held up well but are now close to their peak. I would question whether they will continue to achieve those margins given the economic outlook and the prospect of rising input costs [of raw materials],\" he says.", "Bank profits surge and send markets soaring Stock markets were buoyed on both sides of the Atlantic today as investors cheered better-than-expected profits from the banks and continued growth in manufacturing in most major economies. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, said it was important the Dow Jones managed to crack the 10,600 mark, which has been a major obstacle in the past 10 weeks. \"This could be the sign that the market is finally shrugging off the pessimism that has seen stocks go broadly nowhere since early May,\" he said. Richard Hunter, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, Britain's largest financial adviser, said strong profits from French bank BNP Paribas and HSBC, coupled with manufacturing data showing continued growth in most major economies, had encouraged wary investors back to the market. \"More than 70% of firms in the US S&P 500 index have beaten expectations so far this year. Combined with recent data showing continued economic growth, investor fears of the global economy stalling have eased. Asian markets shrugged off slowing manufacturing growth in China as a sign that the economy would avoid overheating next year. However, Hunter warned that soaring company profits, especially those of larger corporations, were becoming divorced from the wider economy in both the UK and US. \"There is a disconnect between the larger companies that have already been through the pain and made redundancies and the wider economy, which is supported by government spending. With all governments looking to make steep cuts, there are obviously problems ahead.\" A slowdown in export orders last month hit Britain's manufacturing base, according to the latest Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI), fuelling concerns that slow growth in the eurozone and a resurgent pound would choke off a recovery in orders. UK manufacturing maintained its steady growth during July, but largely supported by domestic orders that left the index down only slightly from 57.6 at 57.3. Sluggish growth in the eurozone \u2013 expected to be around 0.5% this year \u2013 could also prove a drag on UK exports. Economists echoed Hunter's warning that the second half of 2010 could prove a difficult environment for manufacturers because of the strength of sterling, which this morning rose to a six-month high against the dollar, at $1.588. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to forecasting group the Ernst & Young Item Club, said that while the figures showed UK manufacturing continued to grow at a strong pace,the detail of the survey betrayed worrying trends: \"In particular, the fact that growth in export orders appears to have stalled. It is encouraging that domestic orders have been able to offset external weakness over the past couple of months, but it would be unrealistic to expect this to continue given the headwinds that are likely to buffet the domestic sector over the next couple of years. The second quarter will probably represent the high point of quarterly manufacturing output growth, though this balance still points to growth of more than 1% for the third quarter,\" he said. Alan Clarke, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said: \"The breakdown showed export orders fell three-quarters of a point to 50.75, the lowest since last August and down around 10 points in the last four months \u2013 a sign that a cooling-off in overseas demand is beginning to hit home.\" Clarke warned that the services sector, which represents the bulk of the UK economy, is a bigger risk. \"This sector has seen its PMI falling for four consecutive months and is four points off the peak,\" he said. \"Last month's services sector Markit/CIPS PMI saw the expectations component collapse, which is typically a good guide to the future evolution of the headline index. Hence Wednesday's July update will be crucial to how the more weighty services sector is likely to affect overall growth.\"Clarke said recent positive figures for the UK, including growth of 1.1% in the second quarter of the year, could represent a high-water mark before the economy slips back. Steep cuts in government spending and higher taxes are expected to bite later this year and into 2011. Across the eurozone, manufacturing was strongest in Germany by a wide margin \u2013 accelerating sharply to hit a three-month high. Italy saw growth accelerate to a pace matching April's post-recession peak and Spain also saw output rise at the fastest pace since April. France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Austria, on the other hand, all saw growth slow compared to post-recession peaks seen earlier in the year."], "2010-7-B2": ["Jersey Shore cast ring Wall Street's opening bell Anway, the stock exchange enjoyed one of its most crowded days in years as Michael \"the situation\" Sorrentino, Pauly \"DJ Pauly D\" Del Vecchio, Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi, Jenni \"J-Woww\" Farley and friends grinned from ear to ear over the trading floor. The Jersey Shore cast were on Wall Street courtesy of MTV's NYSE-listed owner, Viacom, to mark the debut of their second series in the US this week. They didn't hang around for a chat, though. On the business channel CNBC, anchor Mark Haines complained: \"We often interview the ringers of the opening bell, but the Jersey Shore's handlers are not allowing them to talk. They're allowed to stand and smile, but not to talk.\" Wouldn't it have been fun to hear Snooki's thoughts on subprime mortgage-related derivatives?", "Stock market offers opportunities to negate inflation In fact, the demand for these certificates was probably due less to a fear of rampant inflation per se, than to the fact an unexpected surge in RPI to 5% had made their interest rate \u2013 which was set at 1% above RPI depending on the term of the certificate \u2013 very attractive, particularly when it was tax free. It is impossible to find savings rates approaching that anywhere else, which means if inflation stays at this level the buying power of money left on deposit is actually being eroded. There are some other ways to inflation-proof your investments, however. The closest alternative to the withdrawn certificates are index-linked gilts \u2013 government-issued bonds which track RPI. But unlike NS&I products these have not been overly popular \u2013 their return so far this year is the lowest of all government bonds. And unlike NS&I there is no guarantee you will get your money back \u2013 the price of all gilts will rise and fall depending on investor sentiment. Unfortunately, the same is true of the other main way of inflation-proofing your portfolio: investing in the stock market. While, over the long term, the return on shares is well ahead of inflation, the time horizon is key \u2013 as anyone who has endured a dismal performance on equities over the past decade will testify. While many strategists argue that stock markets currently look attractive on a long-term view, uncertainty in the economy means share prices could just as easily fall significantly before they start moving up again. Those who are prepared to take that risk can put together a portfolio of companies that not only offers a reasonable income now, but will continue to do well \u2013 and, therefore, pay increasing dividends \u2013 regardless of the level of inflation. It is possible to put together a portfolio of companies which yield far more than that. Individual shares such as Vodafone, bus operator FirstGroup, National Grid and Standard Life all yield more than 6%. And there are a few companies which have managed to grow their dividends every year for more than a decade \u2013 Tesco, Morrisons and British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco among them. Killik & Co recommends a portfolio of 10 companies, all of which currently pay good dividends with the potential for further growth and which, crucially, also have what is called good dividend cover. This means their annual earnings are substantially more than their annual dividends so they have the scope to continue paying, or even increasing, dividends even if their earnings stagnate or fall. These companies are Vodafone, FirstGroup, GlaxoSmithKline, BAT, AstraZeneca, J Sainsbury plc, Centrica, Halfords, Pearson and Melrose. This would be a diverse portfolio covering a range of sectors and company sizes. But investors would need a substantial sum of money to buy into them all \u2013 and the fewer shares you buy, the bigger the risk to your money should one of them go wrong.", "Europe's bank stress tests - as it happened It's judgement day for Europe's banks. In the next few hours the European Union will publish full details of the health checks that have been conducted on major and minor financial institutions across the region. These test have the power to reassure investors that the banking sector is in robust shape, or spark a new wave of panic. While there has been concern in the markets that if enough banks do not fail the stress tests they will not prove to be credible, Credit Suisse analysts also point out that many banks in the 27 EU countries have already raised funds \u2013 including in Greece, Spain and Ireland, whose economy has been crippled by the property downturn. The market is comparing the EU tests to the one conducted by the US in May 2009, when 10 large banks needed to raise $65bn (\u00a343bn) of fresh funds. The Credit Suisse experts point out the European banking sector has already been bolstered by \u20ac200bn (\u00a3170bn) since then. As Cyclos Securities analyst Constantinos Vergos put it: \"The market expects that ATEbank will need to recapitalise after this afternoon's stress test results.\" As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, ATEBank is also a likely casualty as it has been used to inject funds into Greece's farming sector for many years - and many of those loans have been defaulted on. Its Banks team and European Portfolio Strategy team canvassed 386 experts, and has concluded that 10 banks will fail the tests today. That is a bigger strike rate than we'd been expecting. Goldman also reckons that the tests will show a shortfall of \u20ac38bn. Digging into the survey, there are some outlying forecasts - with a few participants saying that at least 20 banks could fail. At the other end of the graph, some people think you'll be able to count the failures on the fingers of one hand. As Goldman puts it: \"there appears to be very little consensus about the outcome, how much will be raised and what the impact will be.\" Tumpel-Gugerell also told the European Economics and Financial Centre that: It is important to remember that the markets are still acting cautiously in the build-up to the Bank Stress Test results and that the currency markets are likely to fluctuate after 5pm today. That's the verdict of Ralph Silva, director of Silva Research Network. He has predicted that the banks will dodge the issue by simply claiming that they will recapitalise themselves from another bank based in another country in the event of a crisis. Silva also questioned the timing of the tests: \"You don't ask someone to run a marathon a week after they broke their leg. We are stress testing the banks in a position where they are recovering,\" he said. \"By doing these stress tests what we are in fact doing is highlighting the problems that are going to stop them from lending instead of encouraging them to lend,\" Silva added. It's also worth noting that if everyone passes, the tests won't have much validity. Some banks has to fail to prove the tests are rigorous, basically, but not too many as to suggest the whole sector is shot. Although they are thought to assume a theoretical 25% drop in the value of relevant government bonds (eg, the price at which they are traded between investors), they don't actually include the possibility of a European country actually defaulting on its debts. The European Commission, for instance, is trying to calm fears that its decision to allow Spain and Portugal to extend state support to their banks until the end of the year is NOT related to the stress tests. The commission's decision to make the announcement today - just hours ahead of the results of the stress tests - had raised alarm in the markets that Europe's regulators were rushing to put in safety measures ahead of news that banks in the two countries had failed the tests. But a Commission spokesman told Reuters: \"The timing of this is completely unrelated to the publication of stress tests later today.\" Now Moody's has its eyes on Hungary after it ended talks with the IMF and EU on a \u20ac20bn (\u00a317bn) aid deal. Hungarian premier Victor Orban has said he will no longer negotiate with the IMF as he intends to restore the country's \"lost economic self-rule\". The credit ratings agency, however, believes Budapest should commit to the budget deficit targets and accept international help. It has placed Hungary's Baa1 local and foreign currency government bond ratings on review for a possible downgrade. \"Moody's decision to initiate this review was prompted by the increased uncertainty regarding Hungary's fiscal outlook and economic prospects,\" the agency said. \"This uncertainty is the result of the recent breakdown of Hungary's talks with the IMF and EU.\" Standard & Poor's said later that it has revised its outlook on Hungary to negative from stable. It has a BBB-/A-3 rating on the country, which is already lower than Moody's. Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said the tests assume government debt prices fall back to the levels seen at the start of May - at the height of the euro zone crisis - and remain there. \"Also, that the debt crisis is transmitted to the loan books of the banking system,\" he added. A total of 61 banks are in the report, compared with 91 undertaking the test, because some of the smaller banks don't trade, or rarely trade, in the CDS market. Markit concludes: Looking at the tables, it is no surprise to see that the majority of the riskiest banks are in the eurozone's periphery \u2013 Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. These banks have direct exposure to sovereign risk through their holdings of government bonds. They are also exposed to slowing domestic economies brought about by fiscal austerity. \"The haircuts are applied to the trading book portfolios only, as no default assumption was considered,\" according to a confidential document dated July 22 and titled \"EU Stress Test Exercise: Key Messages on Methodological Issues.\" The tests will assume a loss of 23.1% on Greek debt, 14% of Portuguese bonds, 12.3% on Spanish debt, and 4.7% on German state debt while UK government bonds will be subject to a 10% haircut, and France 5.9%. The methodology behind the tests has been released ahead of the actual results of the tests at 5PM London time (1600GMT) in an effort to show how tough the tests really were. Banks failed the test if they were unable to maintain a tier 1 capital ratio of 6% under each scenario. The scenarios used to test Europe's banks were tougher, according to EU regulators and the CEBS, than the scenarios used in last year's stress tests in the US. The European scenarios have a likelihood of happening once every two decades while the US ones could occur once every seven years. The European tests assumed that the European economy would shrink by 3% over 2010 and 2011, with stockmarkets, plunging 20% in both years \u2013 a compound loss of 36%. Credit ratings on securitised products, meanwhile, dropped four notches, although \u2013 as reported earlier \u2013 losses on sovereign debt holdings applied only to bonds the banks traded, not those that they held to maturity. The euro is still down around fell half a cent against the dollar at $1.2820 after news of the methodology behind the stress tests broke. It seems the real worry is about the scenarios employed for losses on sovereign debt. Firstly, there seems to be some anxiety about whether the 23% \"haircut\" applied to Greek debt is really large enough and secondly, the fact the fall in price was only applied to holdings in trading books rather than banking books matters to the market. This is because bonds that banks hold to maturity in their banking books will not the subjected to the test. So any analyst who feels unsatisfied by the haircuts only being applied to trading positions will be able to do their own maths. The Bank of Portugal has declared that all the Portugese banks have passed the tests Nothing on the actual CEBS web site yet, though.... That was largely expected - the shock will be if another German bank has also failed. Meanwhile the full report is now up on the CEBS site - with an \"executive summary\" that covers 55 pages. There'll be some long shifts being pulled in the City tonight..... The testing found that ATEbank would have a Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.36% under the most adverse scenario, leaving it short of \u20ac242.6m. There's clearly massive interest in these tests, as the CEBS website is wobbling and appeared to crash just then. Seems to be working OK now - don't all click at once. I've seen nothing stressful about this test. It's like sending the banks away for a weekend of R&R. The euro has been fluctuating since the tests came out, and is now down again at $1.2831. The results suggest (on the face of it), that Britain's banks are in good shape. Here are their Tier 1 capital ratios under the most adverse scenario: As you can see, the \"sovereign stress\" part of the exercise simulated a run on government debt, but only considered the impact on a bank's trading operations. So (as mentioned earlier today), the tests explicitely do not consider a European country defaulting on its debts. The objective of the CEBS exercise is to undertake an assessment of the strength of EU banks in a consistent manner across institutions and countries. It focused on three different scenarios; a benchmark stress, a more adverse macro-economic stress and a country-wide stress. The benchmark stress identifies movements in parameters such as GDP, unemployment and interest rates and charts a mild deviation away from the pathway which the economy is currently on: it then makes conservative assumptions about the loan losses which will result in this macro-economic scenario. This helps to set a benchmark (mildly stressed scenario) against which the more adverse stress is then applied. The adverse stress assumes a 3 percentage point deviation of GDP for the EU compared to the European Commission's forecasts over the two-year time horizon. The method of translating this scenario to loss rates is also conservative. A further 'sovereign stress' was then applied. This tested the resilience of banks to an increase in the yields of government bonds issued by EU member states. It simulates, (i) the associated medium term uptick in household and corporate sector loan losses in the banking book, and (ii) immediate mark to market losses arising from trading book holdings of government bonds of each country. The actual exposures of each bank to central and local government across the EU have been published by each bank. Results identify the simulated Tier 1 ratios of European banks as well as specific simulations for profit and loss measures. The CEBS results are focused on Tier 1 ratios for comparability across the EU. As expected the outcomes of the stresses demonstrate the preparedness and resilience of the UK banks under unlikely adverse economic scenarios. The FSA has published the high level results for the UK banks. This resilience is a result of the considerable work that has been undertaken to strengthen UK banks in recent years. The CEBS stress test is different but complementary to the FSA's stress testing regime. The long awaited bank stress tests do not seem to have been that stressful after all. This is not surprising. The last thing the authorities would have wanted to do was to set a series of assumptions that would have led to a broad failure across the Euro area, as this could only do more damage to the already frail markets. The most controversial area surrounds the treatment of the banks Sovereign debt holdings. The haircuts on these bonds only applied to the banks trading books, whereas the majority of these bonds are held on the banking books. In some ways this is consistent with the EU's comments that no EU sovereign will be allowed to fail, although of course if there is a Sovereign failure at a later date where the debt is held will make no difference to the actual loss that would be taken. Jenkins also argues that it would be a mistake to think that the seven banks which failed today would be allowed to go under \"in the real world\": They will no doubt either raise capital from the private sector or more likely from their respective governments, as no-one is prepared to undertake another Lehmans like experiment. In conclusion, Jenkins reckons the stress tests will soon be forgotten: My view is that whilst the stress tests do not take into account the worst case scenario of multiple sovereign failures, we know what the impact of such a disastrous backdrop would be anyway; that is a complete collapse of the western worlds financial system! The EU governments will not allow banks to actually fail in the market, thus it is the sovereign bond market that is key in the short term, because there is not anyone who can bail out the governments (aside from printing money). Who they, I hear you mutter. It's Hungary's largest bank, of course. The presence of a Hungarian lender at the top of the list might be slightly embarrassing for the EU, though, given Hungary's particular problems - talks with the International Monetary Fund and the EU broke down last week, which means a \u20ac20bn loan programme has been suspended Only this morning, ratings agency Moody's warned it might downgrade Hungary, pointing to its weak economy as well as its wrangles with the IMF. As they point out, ATEBank of Greece has the lowest capital ratios of any of the Greek banks being tested. It's 77% owned by the Greek state and has long been saddled with problem loans and businesses relating to its role as government lender to the farm sector. Hypo Real Estate of Germany has been nationalized since 2009 after requiring more than \u20ac102 billion in loans and state guarantees after it and its Irish unit Depfa PLC were heavily hit by the financial crisis. It is already being split into a Good bank and Bad bank - something the stress tests didn't take into account. The five Spanish savings banks, known as cajas, had all suffered from the collapse of Spain's property bubble. As promised almost two hours ago, here's the breakdown of how their tier 1 ratios came in (against the target of 6% or higher): City analysts are still digging through the data, so we may have more developments tonight. But if not, thanks for reading.", "Markets nervous ahead of bank stress test results Several of Spain's 18 cajas, including some that have been merged recently, have failed the tests that examine how they would cope with worsening economic conditions. El Pa\u00eds newspaper reported that some of the unlisted savings banks would need more capital if the economy were to worsen sharply and there were sovereign debt crises in several countries. Analysts also believe that Greek banks \u2013 weakened after the bailout of the country by the International Monetary Fund \u2013 as well as German regional banks, known as Landesbanken, are vulnerable. The Landesbanken have yet to account for losses incurred in the wake of writedowns on securitised assets such as collateralised debt obligations. But Manfred Weber, the head of the Association of German Banks, told local radio this morning that he was confident that German banks would \"all in all\" perform well in the tests. \"The markets need to view the tests as being credible to remove any fears about the European banking system,\" said Raghav Subbarao, a currency strategist at Barclays Capital. \"Too few banks failing would lead to the tests not being viewed as credible while too many failures will raise further concerns about the state of the banking system. It is going to be hard to pull off the right balance of successful and failed banks.\" KBW has run its own stress test on banks that are listed across Europe. According to this, 10 banks are likely to fall below the 6% tier one capital ratio and would need to raise \u20ac9.8bn (\u00a38.2bn) \u2013 although the number would be much higher if unlisted institutions were added. The banks that would fail the KBW stress test \u2013 assuming that dividends would be cut to help preserve capital \u2013 are Greek banks National Bank of Greece, Piraeus, EFG, Marfin and Alpha Bank, Portugal's BPI, Germany's Deutsche Post Bank, Italy's Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena, Bank of Ireland and Turkey's BKT. Markets are comparing the EU tests to the one conducted by the US in May 2009, when 10 large banks needed to raise $65bn (\u00a343bn) of fresh funds. Experts at Credit Suisse point out the European banking sector has already been bolstered by \u20ac200bn since then. There are concerns that the banks are being asked to hold more capital at a time when they have been asked by governments to increase lending to households and businesses.", "Cack-handed cashback for Ocado This remarkable opportunity flows from Ocado's cack-handed progress towards flotation. Having berated the world for failing to \"get it\", the company has had to capitulate and admit that the sceptics are too numerous and the price of the shares must be cut beyond the original range. To ensure fair treatment of customers (wise if you're hoping to retain their custom), the Friday get-out clause has been inserted to keep the timetable on track. The confusion is entirely of Ocado's making. The company was asking for trouble in pricing itself at \u00a31bn-plus, given that it was knocking out shares at half that valuation in a private placing last October. Nothing had happened in the past nine months to justify such an increase. What's more, the decision to hire eight banks as advisers backfired. Investors detected an arrogant attempt to quash dissent \u2013 an impression reinforced by those \"they don't get it\" remarks. Future flotation candidates probably won't repeat the trick of hiring a battalion of bankers, so at least the drama should have one lasting benefit. The view here is that the shares are still not cheap enough. Ocado has some smart technology, loyal customers and helpful market trends. But these advantages do not yet add up to profitability and it is too hard to judge when an adequate return on capital will be earned. The investment gamble would look more reasonable if another \u00a3300m was knocked off the asking price. In that sense, Ocado has actually done well to float at \u00a3895m.

Sources close to the company tonight claimed Ocado had orders for around 80% of the shares on offer and insisted that the failure to cover the entire equity on offer with only a day to go was not unusual. The offer is expected to be priced tomorrow night at the lower end of the 200p-275p price range, valuing the business at around \u00a3800m. Conditional trading begins on Wednesday, while the company will be fully listed on Monday, assuming the directors manage to shift the remaining shares. The company is looking to raise \u00a3200m to plough into the business, while existing investors are selling another \u00a3200m of equity.

Clive Black at Shore Capital described the \u00a31.1bn price tag as \"stratospheric\".

However, uncowed by the panel's rebuke, Principle Capital \u2013 where Myerson remains executive chairman and major investor \u2013 is pressing ahead with an extraordinary general meeting it has called on Monday at Aim-listed D1, in which it holds a 27.5% stake. Principle Capital is calling for the current board to be replaced by two of its representatives. Myerson believes D1, which has repeatedly sought additional shareholder funds to keep the business alive, has no realistic future as an independent entity. He wants it to be sold off or broken up and its cash pile returned to investors. While the company claims to be discussing a sale, Myerson has lost patience and is pressing ahead with the meeting, calling for the board to be sacked. He had previously sought to reverse another of his interests, Principle Energy, a sugar-cane biofuels group with operations in Southern Africa, into D1, but his ambitions had been blocked by the board and a large number of shareholders. Yesterday the besieged D1 board issued a statement to investors highlighting the Takeover Panel ruling against Myerson, saying: \"Under the circumstances the board believes it is inappropriate for representatives of Principle Capital to be appointed to the board or for current members of the board to be removed.\" Principle Capital responded: \"We view the statement as a cheap shot by a management that is desperate to cling on at any cost. This management has presided over a catastrophic destruction of value at D1.\" Myerson's cold-shoulder punishment relates to an unconnected power struggle last year at Principle Capital, which at the time was listed on Aim. Myerson and associates were said to have acted in concert, breaching the panel's takeover code, and to have later given explanations that were \"co-ordinated, disingenuous and dishonest\". The three-year cold shoulder is supposed to be the City equivalent of an Asbo, in effect barring Myerson from takeover situations. But Principle Capital, which was subsequently been taken private, believes the punishment does not extend to it, despite Myerson remaining executive chairman and a major investor. Regulatory sources would not be drawn on whether Principle Capital was covered by the cold-shoulder order. Myerson has already failed to overturn the panel finding against him on appeal but continues to argue that it is flawed and is considering taking his case to the European courts.", "Flotations are not being sunk by 'market forces' Where does this leave Ocado? Commendably, the online supermarket surrendered the \"market conditions\" card when it declared itself so unique that squalls were irrelevant. Either there are buyers out there for \u00a3400m of stock at 200p-275p or there are not. If it's the latter, Ocado should cut the price or come back when it's made a profit. But it's pointless telling City analysts that they don't \"get it\" \u2013 everybody is free to shop elsewhere.", "Ocado optimistic despite Fairfield Energy's abandoned flotation Fairfield Energy, a private-equity backed North Sea oil business which specialises in extracting hard-to-access oil from mature fields, had been hoping to raise \u00a3330m, but its offer has been spurned by investors. In a one-line statement this morning, Fairfield said that, \"in the light of market conditions, it has decided against proceeding with its initial public offering of shares and listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange at this time.\" Ocado shares are being offered in the price range of 200-275p and private investors must get their applications in by midnight on Sunday. Institutional investors have until next Tuesday, but privately, many have made it clear they have no intention of buying shares, insisting the business is worth nowhere near \u00a31bn. Ocado's senior management is currently on a marketing roadshow in the US to persuade American investors to buy shares and its directors are in a blackout period, unable to comment on how the sale process is going. But, last night, a source close to the company insisted Fairfield's failure was irrelevant: \"It's an oil well in the North Sea. It is a depleting asset and a finite resource.\" He said the grocer's directors were \"really bored\" with what they believed was negative media coverage and that they remained \"pretty confident\" they would get their float away. Several high-profile City retail analysts have questioned the valuation of the Ocado business. Earlier this week, Clive Black, of Shore Capital, described the price tag as \"stratospheric\". He added: \"It is little short of ludicrous to suggest otherwise\" and is urging investors not to buy the shares \u2013 and to consider shorting them to make money if the price declines. Greg Lawless, of Collins Stewart, believes the shares could be worth just 128p each, while Nick Bubb, of Arden Partners, has suggested the Ocado bosses consider \"a face-saving cut in the price to 160-180p\". A source close to the grocery company said the analysts do not \"get it\" because they are used to assessing the prospects of traditional high street retailers rather than new online business models such as\u00a0Ocado.

The LSE's Turquoise trading platform \u2013 used by hedge funds and high-frequency professional traders \u2013 remained shut until 10.30am, prompting a major internal investigation. By tonight, the LSE admitted the problem may have been caused deliberately. A spokeswoman said: \"Preliminary investigations indicate that this human error may have occurred in suspicious circumstances. The LSE takes this matter very seriously and a full internal investigation has now begun. The relevant authorities have been informed.\" The problems at Turquoise, known in the City as a \"dark pool\" which allows participants to trade anonymously with each another, had major repercussions for the LSE which had been planning to transfer its entire share trading business, known as the main market, to a new system today. The LSE had been under pressure from its customers to delay the introduction of the new computer system to allow further network upgrades even before the latest problems but has now been forced to abandon any updates until next year. \"The LSE will work in partnership with customers to agree a date as early and practicably as possible in 2011 to reschedule the main market migration,\" the exchange said. The systems delays will be an embarrassment to the LSE's chief executive Xavier Rolet who bought the Sri Lankan company MillenniumIT last year to allow the exchange to overhaul its current technology systems so it can compete with the alternative trading platforms which have been springing up and posing a threat to the LSE. The explosion of rival trading platforms has meant that trading in the biggest stocks in London has been drifting away from the LSE, which is now accounts of around 60% of trading in shares in FTSE 100 companies. By moving to the technology provided by MillenniumIT, the LSE was hoping to be able to offer the fastest trading platform in the world. The transfer of Turquoise onto the new technology last month had already caused problems for the exchange, after it suffered glitches on its first day.", "Stock markets move higher ahead of Federal Reserve announcement Stock markets moved sharply higher today in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will tomorrow night announce plans to pump more money into the flagging US economy. Analysts are expecting Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to push ahead with up to $1tn of quantitative easing (QE) to help spur growth and cut unemployment. Other central bank policymakers meeting this week, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank on Thursday, will pay close attention. The chances of further QE from the UK authorities increased today after new figures showed that Britain's construction sector grew more slowly than expected in October \u2013 suggesting it is unlikely to make as big a contribution to GDP in the final quarter as it did earlier in the year. The latest construction purchasing managers index fell to 51.6 from 53.8 in September \u2013 its lowest for eight months \u2013 and below forecasts. This still indicates growth, but at a slowing pace. Activity in the housing and civil engineering sectors is falling but commercial construction grew strongly. New orders continued to rise, albeit at the slowest rate since February. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index, said: \"Considering how prominent growth in construction played in the recent better-than-expected first reading of UK growth in the third quarter, this could be seen as a bit of a warning sign towards how GDP could fare in the fourth quarter.\" The FTSE 100 finished 62.81 points higher at 5757.43, close to a new six-month high, with Wall Street ahead more than 70 points by the time London closed. US shares were also lifted by the expectation of strong Republican gains in the US mid-term elections. Meanwhile, the expectation of further QE by the Fed sent the dollar sharply lower, which in turn boosted commodity prices. Oil rose more than 1% to more than $84 a barrel, while copper climbed from $8,300 a tonne to $8,418. This week's strong Chinese manufacturing figures are also supporting base metal prices. The Australian dollar again passed parity with its US counterpart after the central bank in Sydney unexpectedly raised interest rates. Ilya Spivak, currency analyst at Daily FX, said: \"Should [the Fed's QE programme] materialize, the spotlight will fall on the tone of the accompanying policy statement as traders comb it for clues on where the Fed plans to move going forward. \"On balance, a relatively dovish outcome is likely to boost risk appetite to drive shares, key commodities and the pound against the dollar higher. Any signs of reluctance about renewed QE or a smaller amount in asset purchases would likely have the opposite effect.\"", "Quantitative easing boost keeps world stock markets buoyant Stock markets rallied for a second day this morning and gold hit a new record in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to inject more money into the US economy. Copper and oil also strengthened, with both hitting two-year highs as the weak dollar continued to drive the boom in commodities. Traders cautioned that the optimism could be short-lived, though. \"Quite how long the gains can be sustained remains to be seen and the risk of some opportunistic profit-taking ahead of the weekend break shouldn't be overlooked either, but Asia seems to have avoided this reversion and for the time being it's simply a case of buying across the board,\" said Ben Potter, market strategist at IG Markets. The dollar steadied somewhat this morning after touching an 11-month low against a basket of currencies yesterday. US non-farm payrolls data today is expected to show that 60,000 new jobs were created in October across America, although it is unlikely to be enough to bring the near-10% jobless rate down. \"With the firing of census workers having ended and private demand for workers rising, payrolls should post their first increase since May, but it won't be enough to get the unemployment rate down quickly,\" said James Knightley at ING. David Buik at BGC Partners said: \"There is no quick solution to this issue. In the 60s, 70s and 80s recessions, which were unemployment driven, it took about eight months to redress the trend. Between 2000 and 2004 it took two to three years. This recession is the deepest for 80 years. It has been going 17 months and the end is not in sight. 65,000 jobs may have been created in October, but to see some light at the end of the tunnel we need to see 100,000 to 150,000 jobs being created.\"", "World stock markets rally on Fed move In London the FTSE 100 hit its highest level in nearly 29 months, with other European markets also showing strong gains. US stocks also rallied, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 1% when Wall Street opened. Last night the Fed announced a second round of QE in which it will inject $600bn (\u00a3370bn) \u2013 $75bn a month \u2013 into the economy through asset purchases by the end of June next year in an attempt to revive the flagging recovery. Most analysts had expected the Fed to pump in $500bn. \"It seems that in the very short term, the market has received QE2 well, but with jobless data round the corner and the health of the recovery now under even closer scrutiny, any real vindication of the policy could take months to emerge,\" said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, director of private client research at Charles Stanley, said the Fed was unlikely to be able to launch a third bout of QE next year. \"The final months of the QE2 programme are likely to be dominated by talk along the lines of 'will the Fed do a QE3?' The newly appointed Congress is going to say 'no',\" he said. When the reinvestment of maturing debt held by the Fed is added in, monthly Treasury purchases will be around $110bn, according to a statement issued by the New York Fed yesterday. Thus the total programme amounts to $850bn- $900bn. The Dow Jones closed up 26.41 points at 11,215.13 last night, its highest level for two years. Today it gained another 124 points in early trading to 11,339. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei index jumped 198.80 points today, or 2.2%, to 9358.78. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.7% to 24535.63 while China's Shanghai composite index rose 1.9% to 3086.94.

Todd Combs, until now the relatively little-known chief executive of Castle Point Capital, is joining the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate in a move that puts him among the frontrunners to replace Buffett. The \"Sage of Omaha\", who celebrated his 80th birthday at the end of August, said Combs's appointment followed a long search conducted by himself and his partner Charlie Munger. Analysts said it was unusual for Berkshire Hathaway to make such a public statement about a new appointment. Combs has run Castle Point for the past five years. The fund focuses on financial stocks, and appears to have weathered the recent crisis relatively well. According to Reuters, the company achieved a 14% return on investment in 2006, and 17% in 2007. It lost 5.7% during the turbulence of 2008, but gained 6.2% last year. Like Buffett, Combs writes an annual letter to his shareholders. In July he wrote: \"We may begin with the acknowledgment of the pervasive reality of failure \u2013 that, for instance, 99.9% of biological species that have ever existed are now extinct... Or, a little close to home, that only one original member of the Dow Jones industrial index continues to be a member today.\" Buffett, whose net worth was estimated this year at $47bn (\u00a330bn), has previously indicated that his work would be divided among several people when he finally left Berkshire Hathaway. This would see a new chief executive appointed, plus at least one other person handling the investment decisions. Buffett has not given any indication that he is planning to retire, and has often appeared reluctant to relinquish the reins at Berkshire Hathaway. He told shareholders in 2007: \"I've reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death \u2013 abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term 'thinking outside the box'.\"", "Stock markets rally after G20 accord Stock markets rallied this morning after finance ministers from the G20 nations vowed to avert a currency war that could derail the global economic recovery. The FTSE 100 in London climbed nearly 50 points to 5790.34 in early trading, a gain of 0.8% while Germany's Dax was up 40 points at 6646.39 and France's CAC rose about 14 points to 3882.71. At their weekend meeting in South Korea G20 finance ministers agreed to refrain from devaluing their currencies to gain competitive advantage, although they failed to adopt concrete targets to address trade imbalances. As a result, the trend of selling the dollar continued - the greenback hit a 15-year low against the yen, falling 1% to \u00a580.52. The euro shot above the $1.40 mark and the pound also strengthened, rising to $1.5764 from $1.5669. Some analysts played down the importance of the G20 and said the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve will pump more money into the economy next week was more significant. \"The G20 was seen as a hurdle by some and now that is over, investors are back to what they are most comfortable with - dollar selling,\" said Anita Dudani, G10 currency strategist at RBS.", "Singapore bourse makes $8.3bn offer for Australian stock exchange The combined exchange company would be the world's fifth-largest by market value and rank as the second-largest stock market in Asia by number of listed companies, the two exchanges said in a joint statement. But by other measures it would still rank behind Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. The deal aims to give both exchanges a better chance of prospering amid increased competition within Asia and as cross-border trading platforms like Chi-X Europe usurp the dominance of established stock exchanges. The Australian Securities Exchange, known as ASX, is set to lose its monopoly on operating a stock market in Australia in 2011 and an affiliate of Chi-X Europe is planning to set up a trading system once the monopoly is abolished. Singapore, meanwhile, has long lagged behind Hong Kong and Tokyo as a regional financial centre. \"The capital flow we see today is really changing from west to east,\" said Singapore Exchange chief executive Magnus Bocker at a news conference. \"This will be the gateway to Asian capital markets.\" The exchange operating company formed from the takeover of ASX would have a market value of $12.3bn and be responsible for some 2,700 listed companies. According to September data from the World Federation of Exchanges, the combined exchange would list companies worth about $1.9tn, the fourth most in Asia behind Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange have a total market capitalisation of $12.3tn, the most in the world. Combined trading volume of the Singaporean and Australian exchanges was worth about $1tn during the first nine months of the year, the sixth most in Asia and far behind global leader NYSE which has had volume worth $13.8tn in the January-to-September period. ASX shares surged more than 20% when trading resumed after the announcement to AU$43.49. Shares in Singapore Exchange, also known as SGX, fell 5.3% to 9.04 Singapore dollars (\u00a34.41). The companies hope to finalise the deal in the second quarter of 2011, but will need the approval of regulators in each country including Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan. \"I don't think we would have announced it if we didn't believe that the approvals would be forthcoming,\" ASX chief executive Robert Elstone said. The chief of Australia's competition regulator said he did not see any potential problems with the proposed deal. \"I think it's a matter between the Singapore Exchange and the Australian exchange, and I can't see that raising competition issues for us,\" Graeme Samuel, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. \"Of course we're much more focused on the potential for new competitors to enter into the Australian market in terms of stock exchange dealings,\" he said.", "Social networks offer free access to the beating pulse of the nation It's taken a while for the penny to drop, but finally the world is waking up to the fact that the phenomenon of social networking might actually tell us useful things about what's happening out there in the world beyond the Washington Beltway and the Westminster village. Not only that, but the resulting data might even be useful for predicting what's likely to happen. Bollen and his colleagues set out to investigate whether public sentiment, as expressed in large-scale collections of daily Twitter posts, can be used to predict the stock market. They used a standard psychological tool to measure mood along six dimensions \u2013 calmness, alertness, sureness, vitality, kindness and happiness \u2013 and then analysed nearly 10m tweets posted by 2.7 million users between 28 February and 19 December 2008 to extract indicators of mood implicit in tweets. They then looked for evidence of correlation between different kinds of mood and movements in the Dow Jones industrial\u00a0average. They concluded that the predictive accuracy of standard stock-market prediction models was significantly improved when certain mood dimensions were included (for example \"calm\" and \"happiness\" as one measure of mood), but not others \u2013 \"general happiness\" being one example. Once upon a time, this kind of research would have attracted only the derisive snorting of technophobes. Why should we take seriously the 140-character vapourings of geeks and media types? What we really need to know is what \"ordinary\" or \"normal\" people think. The problem with that kind of technophobic scepticism is that cyberspace is increasingly coming to look like the \"real\" world. The demographic characteristics of Twitter's 200 million users (or of Facebook's 500 million) are undoubtedly still a bit skewed compared with those of the population as a whole, but over time that will change: these social networks will increasingly be made up of folks like you and me. In which case, the communications that go on between their members will become the best guide we have to the zeitgeist. If Ed Miliband wants to have a finger on the pulse of the nation, then the smartest thing he could do would be to hire a few geeks and set them to work.", "Oil and gold recover after China's rate rise \"It seems to me there was a very knee-jerk reaction to the China move across all commodities, and now people are starting to step back and think about what it actually means for Chinese growth,\" said Yingxi Yu, commodities analyst at Barclays Capital in Singapore. \"The answer is probably not much. The actual impact of this rate hike might be limited on the overall growth story in China.\" Yesterday's rally in the dollar proved short-lived. It slipped 0.2% against a basket of major currencies today following yesterday's gain of more than 1.6%. China's key stock index closed 0.07% higher after a volatile session. The Shanghai Composite Index finished the day at 3,003.95 points, after falling nearly 2% earlier on. By contrast, most other Asian markets closed lower although they pared earlier losses. Japan's Nikkei index fell 1.7%, to 9,381.60, its lowest close in two weeks. Australia's benchmark index was off 0.7% at 4,623.5 while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slid 0.9% to 23,543.59. Analysts said traders were using the interest rate hike as an excuse for profit-taking.", "China's interest rate rise sends global markets into turmoil China sent financial markets into turmoil after it increased its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points with effect from tomorrow. The move to raise rates by a quarter percentage point was flagged by the Chinese authorities as an internal signal to property developers that rampant house price inflation was intolerable and would be controlled by the Beijing government. However, the rise was seen more widely as appeasing US policymakers, who have called for China to increase the value of its currency. The IMF warned earlier this month that the world economy was threatened by attempts to artificially depress currency values. China has long been accused by the US administration of maintaining low interest rates to keep the value of its currency low and exports cheap. The pound reacted by falling more than two cents against the dollar in mid-afternoon trading, while the euro was 1% lower on the day at $1.3805 Stock markets reacted badly to the news with Germany's Dax down 41.10 points, or 0.6%, at 6475.53, while the CAC-40 in France was 20.99 points, or 0.6%, lower at 3813.51. The FTSE-100 index of leading British shares was down at 5,711, a drop of more than 30 points. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 146.18 points at 10,997.51. Hitendra Dave, head of global markets at HSBC India, said internal pressures led to the rise. \"China hasn't raised so far and [they] have only been raising the reserve requirements. With all the asset price speculation, they had to raise rates to normalise policy. It is the local factors that led them to take this decision.\" Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange at the Dutch bank ING, said: \"This is part of the moderate tightening cycle that we are seeing from Chinese authorities to balance their economy. It is part of the normalisation of interest rates in an economy which is growing at a modestly fast clip. \"The market is reacting like there is an increased risk of hard landing with the commodity currencies like the Aussie being sold off, but I don't think that is the case,\" he said. Simon Derrick, of Bank of New York Mellon, said the move was fuelling speculation that Beijing was involved in backdoor deals with the US administration to nudge its currency upwards. \"The move follows a clear need by the Chinese authorities to take out some of the heat from the economy. Whether this will lead to a broader move on its currency is open to debate. It certainly leads to speculation that the US and China are in some sort of a deal which will perhaps see the US taking a more gradualist approach to quantitative easing. The dollar has already moved higher after this news,\" he said.", "Thomson Reuters columnist resigns over failure to disclose share ownership The Reuters code of conduct forbids journalists from writing about shares they own unless they notify their interest to their manager and from dealing in shares about which they have written recently or intend to write in the near future. David Schlesinger, Reuters' editor-in-chief, told staff in an internal note today that several other cases had come to light as a result of questioning Reuters Breakingviews staff where disclosures to readers or managers could or should have been made. \"While we have no evidence the journalist was abusing his position for financial gain, we take such breaches extremely seriously and that journalist resigned with immediate effect during our investigation,\" said Schlesinger. He added that Collins wrote commentary about companies in which he had a financial interest and made trades shortly afterwards. The investigation is continuing, Scheslinger added. Reuters said it had added these disclaimers to a total of 53 online columns by the three journalists dating back to February 2009 \u2013 the majority written by Collins. The disclaimer has been added to all relevant archived columns to say whether the commentators held shares in the companies at the time and if they traded them shortly before or after publication. A total of 36 of the columns were published in 2009, while 17 were published this year. From March 2009, Collins commentated on the financial affairs of 15 companies in which he owned shares. It is not clear for how long Collins owned shares in the companies mentioned before they were published. The most recent column, published on 29 September and written by Collins, is on the BP executive board reshuffle after the Gulf oil disaster. Shares in the company reached a three-month high in the days following the news. Unmack owned shares in Lloyds TSB contingent convertible bonds \u2013 dubbed \"CoCos\" \u2013 from mid-December 2009 up until mid-July this year and during that period he wrote about the company seven times. Doyle owned shares in RBS and the Bank of Ireland when writing about the companies. Collins said in his email to Dixon, seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk, that he dealt shares \"infrequently\" and that he \"saw an opportunity\" in BP as the price fell in the aftermath of the Gulf oil spill. \"I failed to connect my comments for Reuters \u2013 among millions of words written on BP at the time \u2013 with the purchases,\" Collins writes. \"I had read Reuters' rules about share dealing on joining the company in March 2009, but my recollection was incorrect. I did recall the phrase 'The test is whether the editorial activity might continue to have an impact on the securities.' This is surely the point of the rules.\" He also admitted that he had sold a \"substantial\" stake in Marks & Spencer, obtained from his late father's estate, just five days after commenting on the company's financial results. \"As with BP, I view this as a serious, but technical breach of the rules. At no stage do I consider that I have abused my position at Reuters,\" Collins said \"On discovering the second breach, I felt I had no choice but to offer my resignation, which you accepted on 15 October... I am saddened and embarrassed by my breaches of the rules and hope that you will shortly be able to draw a line under this unfortunate episode.\" He went on to write a twice-weekly column for the London Evening Standard. Known for his acerbic style, he was named financial journalist of the year at the British Press Awards in 2002. He joined Thomson Reuters as a columnist in early 2009, moving to Breakingviews when the financial commentary website was bought by the news agency last year. Doyle is a former Daily Telegraph and Economist journalist, specialising in investment banking. Unmack writes about credit markets, hedge funds and Italy for Reuters Breakingviews and previously worked for Bloomberg News and Euromoney Institutional Investor. Thomson Reuters said it was reviewing procedures and training and had called on all Reuters staff to review their involvement in the financial markets to make sure they were complying with the code.

That idea has no hope of preventing \"strategic leaks\" \u2013 those in which the leaker seeks an advantage by putting a few facts in the public domain (for example, an investment banker trying to bounce his wavering client into launching a takeover bid). Determined leakers will simply continue to bypass official channels in the knowledge that the FSA's police cannot be everywhere. There will be always be fat fees to be earned by doing deals and the mobile phone cannot be uninvented. But the FSA's diktat may influence behaviour in the day-to-day interactions between the press and the City. The FSA, in effect, has handed companies and their advisers a licence to refuse to talk on any matter that can be deemed remotely price-sensitive. Indeed, the process seems to be under way already. What will this achieve? Newspapers, whose appetite for scoops will never be dimmed, will be more inclined to publish stories without verifying facts. Companies will be less able to use common sense when talking to journalists. And the vacuum will be filled by the most artful leakers, whose whispered words will achieve greater rarity and thus greater power. The FSA should listen to the media's across-the-board condemnation of its proposals. Yes, of course we have an interest in encouraging sources to talk.

Of those, 20 businesses left after being involved in a merger, the study said. Non M&A-related delistings remained stable at 25, following 24 in the first and second quarters. \"The levelling out of delistings over the last three quarters, once M&A activity is factored out, suggests some companies are in fact being acquired before they are forced to delist because of financial stress,\" said Charles Wilson, partner at Trowers & Hamlins. AIM, which lists about 1,200 business with a combined market value of \u00a358bn, is commonly used by entrepreneurs to either expand, or sell their business. The number of new entrants on the market rose to 16 in the third quarter, compared with just two in the second quarter last year, in the midst of the credit crunch. The figures are still far behind the 28 debutants in the second quarter of 2008, when equity investors \u2013 ignoring the deep crisis in credit markets \u2013 welcomed new issues. \"As with the rest of the economy, AIM's recovery is proving not to be a sudden bounceback but more of a slow crawl,\" said Chris Lowry, a partner at UHY Hacker Young. \"It could be some years before we see companies joining at the rate we saw pre-recession.\" The number of companies that abandoned the market due to financial stress or insolvency rose slightly to eight in the third quarter, but an improvement from the 27 business that left over the same period last year. \"Whilst AIM's wounds are healing, the recession is clearly leaving scars that will take time to disappear,\" Wilson said."], "2010-9-B2": ["Dairy Crest insists it's not for sale after M\u00fcller reveals stake Mark Allen, Dairy Crest's chief executive, said he planned to keep his company independent as he announced that strong sales of cheese had boosted the group's first-half sales in the face of a competitive milk market. Speaking after the company behind M\u00fcllerlight and M\u00fcller Corner disclosed a 3.04% stake in Dairy Crest, Allen said: \"M\u00fcller hasn't made an approach and we are not soliciting approaches from anyone. We've got a very good business and think we are doing a pretty good job by ourselves.

Furthermore, its four other biggest brands \u2013 Country Life butter, the Clover and St Hubert Omega 3 spreads and the Frijj milkshake \u2013 also recorded higher revenues this year than last, the company said. However, Allen cautioned that the market for milk is \"presently\" very competitive as supermarkets engage in a price war. Suppliers are bearing the brunt of these price reductions, which are eroding their profit margins. Earlier this week, Morrison extended Dairy Crest's milk supply contract until 2015, although neither party would say whether the supermarket was paying it less than under the previous arrangement. At the time, Robert Wiseman declined to comment on speculation that it had been forced to lower its prices to match those of a competitor in order to keep a contract with Tesco, Britain's biggest retail chain. The price war was kicked off by Asda when it started selling four-pint bottles for \u00a31.25 \u2013 and two bottles for \u00a32. This prompted Tesco to slash the price of a four-pint container from \u00a31.43 to \u00a31.25 earlier this month.

With thousands of unsold or repossessed homes across the US and near 10% unemployment, analysts warned that any plans by the Fed to flood the economy with cheap money in another round of quantitative easing would fail to bolster confidence among homebuyers. Home sales in the US stayed at 288,000 a year in August, the same level as July and the second lowest since records began in 1963. Average prices fell to a level not seen since December 2003, according to figures from the Commerce Department. \"There is no upside momentum in housing, period,\" said Eric Green, chief market economist at TD Securities in New York who correctly forecast the level of sales. \"Unemployment is so high, consumer confidence is so low, household wealth is eroded and the psychology remains negative.\" August's durable goods report, suggested the recovery in the manufacturing sector has faded significantly. This was shown by the slowdown in the three-month on three-month growth rate of core orders from 26.2% in May to -4.1%.\" The only bright spot was a report that showed orders for capital equipment rebounded in August, signalling business investment is holding up better than some economists projected. Michael Woolfolk, an analyst at Bank of New York Mellon said the wild swings in US data meant it was difficult to draw conclusions from one month's figures. \"The devil continues to be in the detail of this report, as large swings in commercial aircraft and defence orders cause the headline to consistently miss consensus expectations. While the headline number was a modest disappointment, everything else proved positive.\" Stock markets focused on the capital investment figures, which were positive for the third month in the last four, and better than expected figures from across the eurozone. The FTSE 100 finished up 51 points at 5598, while the German Dax and French CAC bourses were up almost 2%. The Dow rose 1.75% at 10,848. Markets also welcomed the budget cuts and investments in job creation by the Spanish government. Earlier, the news that German business confidence unexpectedly rose in September, as measured by the Ifo Institute, was diluted by the fact that most businesses in Europe's biggest economy expect tougher conditions in the months ahead as the global economic recovery slows down.", "Brazil's oil firm Petrobras aims for largest share issue in history Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petrobras is aiming to sell a record-breaking $64bn (\u00a341bn) worth of shares to investors this week \u2013 the latest and biggest sign of the developing nation's recent ascent through the ranks of world finance. The offering is set to become the largest issue to date, surpassing the $36bn raised by Japanese telecoms company NTT in 1987 and the $24bn raised by the Royal Bank of Scotland in June 2008, when the lender rushed to inflate its corporate buffers as the credit crunch started to deepen. Investors are flocking to emerging markets, bonds and natural resources as they escape moribund equity markets in Europe and the US. Meanwhile, developing economies such as Brazil are booming as they sell oil, minerals and metals at record prices. Their financial systems have also been less battered by the credit crunch than those in the west, as their more traditional banks avoided the complex sub-prime lending deals that led to the global recession. Rio-based Petrobras, an offshore oil driller, will use the funds raised to help finance its $224bn investment plan through 2014. As many as 26 investment banks have been appointed to distribute the shares, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Banco Santander and Citigroup. Petrobras, already the fifth largest publicly listed oil and gas firm, aims to make Brazil one of the world's biggest oil exporters. It plans to tap oil buried under the sea floor in a region known as the subsalt. Deals such as Brazilian ethanol and sugar company ETH's purchase of rival Brenco have lifted Brazil to the world's number five rank in mergers and acquisitions this year \u2013 up from eighth over the same period last year \u2013 according to Dealogic. Only the US, Britain, China and Canada have struck more deals than the South American country. Brazil is also ranked seven in terms of equity issues \u2013 up from 10th last year \u2013 and 21st in debt transactions, a jump from its 29th rank in 2009. Banks are expanding their operations in Sao Paulo, Brasilia or Rio as they try to exploit the country's rich mineral reserves, including iron ore, aluminium or copper. Brazil is also rich in soya beans, fruit, coffee, sugar and cotton. The Petrobras sale is also expected to attract interest from energy investors, who have rushed into natural resource companies as they perceive them to be safer than the recently volatile credit and equity markets. Gold last week reached a record of $1,274 per troy ounce, while Exchange Traded Funds have proliferated in stock markets across Europe as investors seek exposure to commodities and energy.

The index is not \u2013 and hasn't been for years \u2013 a rough approximation of UK plc.

However the euphoria was short-lived, with shares dropping back in the settlement period that follows the official close of business at 4.30pm. The FTSE eventually ended the day at 5996.07, up more than 12 points on the day and still the highest stock market close of the year. The late drama came at the end of a day when it appeared that the FTSE would end tantalisingly short of reaching the milestone, after rising to just above 5999 in morning trading. Trading in London was thin as a combination of the bad weather and the imminent Christmas holiday kept traders away from their desks. The volume of shares changing hands was just 38% of the 90-day average on the final full day before the break. The market has been on an upward trend for several weeks, putting on more than 400 points in December alone. Until today, the FTSE had not been above 6000 since June 2008, when markets were awash with short-lived confidence following the takeover of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan in the spring of that year. Share prices dropped back later in the summer as fears for the health of the global banking system were rekindled by the problems of the US mortgage lenders \u2013 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae \u2013 and then plunged in the final three months of 2008 following the month of market chaos that greeted the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. While the City has been buoyed by the upward trend in other stock markets \u2013 particularly Wall Street \u2013 London has also benefitted from the high preponderance of mining companies in the FTSE 100. Strong growth in Asia has led to a sharp rise in commodity prices this year and energy shares led today's rise, underpinned by gains in the price of crude which hit a 2010 high of more than $91 a barrel in New York tonight. Some consumer stocks enjoyed a reprieve after days of pressure from cold weather in most of Britain. With temperatures beginning to rise, retailers hoped for a last-minute dash to the shops. DIY group Kingfisher rose 2.2% and fashion retailer Next gained 1.8%. Tour operator Tui Travel was ahead 2.5% as more travellers were able to leave on Christmas breaks. Dealers have also become more confident about the prospects for 2011 in recent weeks amid hopes that the crisis in the eurozone will not spread from the small peripheral countries to Spain. \"Expectations have improved a lot because we haven't had a double dip [recession], earnings are strong and the consensus for the economy next year will be strong,\" said Mark Bon, fund manager at Canada Life in London. However, with the sovereign debt crisis in the background Bon didn't think people were \"all-out bullish\", adding that the other concern was whether China would be successful in cooling its property market. Jimmy Yates, head of equities at CMC Markets, said: \"Where there is a will there is a way and it seems the market's will is for the FTSE above the 6000 level by the end on 2010.\" Fresh signs of a pick-up in growth emerged from the US. Durable goods orders rose and real consumption increased by 0.3% in November following a 0.5% increase in October.", "Sleigh bells ring for price of copper as mystery trader fills Christmas stocking A mystery trader has accumulated up to 90% of the copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) amid a dramatic rise in the price of the metal, driven by demand from China and other emerging economies. Copper prices have stormed to record levels this week and today closed at $9,403 (\u00a36,063) a tonne as speculation swirled about the identity of the trading house sitting on the large position at the LME which has been steadily rising since the middle of November. The position is worth around $3bn and could include existing holdings as well as derivatives to buy the metal in the future. Other commodity prices also rose today. Oil pushed through the $90 a barrel level for only the third time in two years, after the banking crisis raised fears of a slow down in the world economy and a cut in demand for oil and other commodities. Data in the US fuelled the surge after showing that crude oil supply fell more than expected last week. Precious metals have also hit fresh highs recently. Silver has reached its highest levels 30 years while palladium has traded at prices last seen in 2001. The creation of such a dominant position in copper has mesmerised traders and helped fuel anxiety about the supply of copper, which is in turn driving the price higher. As it is, mines are finding it difficult to keep up with the demand for a metal that, according to analysts at Barclays Capital, is at its highest ever levels. Copper is used for wires and cables and is enjoying high levels of demand as emerging economics install more electricity and telecommunications, but also because renewable energy sources require the use of copper. But trading today was also driven by new worries about supply caused by shipping problems at the world's largest copper mine in Chile \u2013 Collahuasi. The LME first began to report that a so-called dominant position in copper had been accumulated on 17 November, but in recent days the size of this position has increased from \"50% to 80%\" to \"80% to 90%\". While US investment bank JP Morgan has been linked to the position, market sources insisted that this was not the case. A festive-themed note from analysts at Barclays Capital predicted that rising demand for commodities could keep prices buoyant next year. \"Europe might be facing Arctic-type temperatures, but the base metals markets are heating up. Copper is the metal that appears to be everyone's favourite stocking filler, with prices rising to a new record high, punching well above $9,000 per tonne. The sleigh bells are ringing for the other metals too, driven by improving demand, the ongoing economic recovery and tightening market balances,\" Barclays Capital said. \"[The year] has witnessed a number of surprises, but the real Christmas cracker has been the strength of the recovery in demand, which will be a record high for all the base metals except tin. Emerging market demand has been the single biggest swing factor, coming in well above market forecasts.\" China consumes 35% to 40% of the world's annual copper output, although there is some expectation in the markets that the metal could be swapped for aluminium in some products, which would help to ease pressure on demand. The demand for commodities is also being driven by the creation of so-called exchange traded funds, which allow investors to bet on the price of metals such as copper. The LME said it was not unknown for one trader to hold large positions. Diarmuid O'Hegarty, head of regulation and compliance, said: \"Dominant long positions are not unusual and the LME has proven processes for dealing with these positions.\" To stop buyers cornering the market and manipulating the price, the rule is that once a trader has more than 50% they are obliged to lend the metal back to the market, if the demand arises, at predetermined prices set by the LME. \"As a market of last resort, we do not stop people from buying metal; we restrict their behaviour depending on how much they buy. In times of short supply the LME stocks are often used as a source of material and in times of excess supply LME warehouses are used to store the metal,\" O'Hegarty said.", "One small retailer's profit warning does not a bleak Christmas make The analysts' working theory is this: big one-stop retailers, like the supermarkets and large department stores, win and the specialist stores lose. That sounds like a reasonable guess: why trawl around the high street in the snow when you can get more Christmas presents under one roof?"], "2010-12-B1": ["A Christmas rally? Plenty. The woes of the eurozone have been relegated to down-page status since the European Central Bank starting buying bonds aggressively a fortnight ago, but that doesn't mean the problems have gone away. There are several factors at work. One is anxiety about what the grand two-day EU summit, which starts on Thursday, will bring. The big question is whether the current bailout fund will be beefed up to a size capable of intimidating markets. Then there is a tricky issue of how to design a permanent crisis fund to work after 2013 and how to force investors to take \"haircuts\" or losses; these can be scary subjects for markets, as we saw in Ireland. The other factor gnawing away is the realisation that the return of inflation \u2013 if that's what we are witnessing \u2013 adds yet another layer of complexity. It's not just the hit to growth if borrowing costs rise. Quantitative easing, which markets have come to regard as the central bankers' panic button, even in the eurozone, becomes harder to activate. Shares can keep rising in such a climate, but, after such a strong December rally, it's probably not the way to bet if those Spanish bond yields keep climbing. The end of the year could yet be nervy.", "Betfair: Goldman Sach's duffest flotation of the year Some high-rolling poker players have disappeared; horse-racing is declining in popularity; and gamblers are risking less when budgets are tight. These are minor complaints: it's just that there is a lot of them. At 990p, Betfair is obviously a more enticing prospect. Today's trading numbers were a setback but not a disaster: the core British business is well established and should still churn out decent sums of cash. But there is little clarity on the adventures into new territories \u2013 the US and financial markets \u2013 that were the other factor behind the princely float valuation. California will allow exchange wagering on horse-racing from May 2012. Fine, but let's see how the conservative, and powerful, American horse-racing lobby reacts. It is also far too early to say how the LMAX financial exchange will prosper \u2013 it's only been open for a few months. Until the picture becomes less fuzzy, putting a fair value on Betfair is an exercise in educated guesswork. There is room for honest disagreement. From the point of view of Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the sponsors to the float, the concern will be the behaviour of the insiders, Betfair's long-standing investors who still dominate the register. The first lock-up agreements come off next autumn. If the shares still stand well below \u00a313 then, it would be embarrassing for the investment banks if there's a rush to sell.", "Rights issues reform requires pressure on chief executives", "Inquiry calls for full disclosure rights issue fees   Companies which tap investors for cash should be required to provide a break-down of fees paid to investment banking advisors to stop them being overcharged, according to an inquiry into rights issues published today. The inquiry, led by a group of City investors, found that companies which conducted rights issues were charged fees that were 10 times more than they paid their own directors. The cost is ultimately borne by shareholders who are ordinary savers and investors in pension funds and who only receive an aggregate figure of fees paid. The inquiry could find no \"plausible justification\" for the rise in fees that has taken place since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission conducted an investigation into the issue 13 years ago, aside from the period during the banking crisis. Underwriting fees were 2% before the MMC, rose to 2.9% afterwards and hit an average of 3.4% in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The Office of Fair Trading launched an inquiry in June and is due to publish its findings next month. A record \u00a349.4bn was raised by rights issues in 2009, smashing the pervious record in 2008 of \u00a327bn when banks were forced to tap shareholders for cash. Douglas Ferrans, chairman of the Rights Issue Fees Inquiry (RIFI), said: \"Companies are paying too much to ensure the deal is a success. On average companies who have had rights issues have paid ten times more in fees than that which was paid to their executive team in total reward. Whilst remuneration rightly comes under the spotlight, very little light is shone on these larger numbers.\" Leading City investors do not want to radically overhaul rights issues which allow existing shareholders the \"right\" to buy new shares being issued to prevent their influence being diluted by new investors arriving on the register. But Ferrans noted: \"Companies and their shareholders are not getting a fair deal and that needs to change.\" The inquiry calls for fees paid for underwriting and advisory services to be disclosed to the stock market and in the next annual report. Companies should also consider whether they might only need to underwrite part of their issue to reduce the cost. One of the ways to do this is with greater consultation. This presents problems of putting insiders in receipt of information that could move a share price so the inquiry suggests that institutional shareholders should consider appointing those who can be taken \"off market\" to discuss such matters with companies. The inquiry was led by City investor groups including the Investment Management Association, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF). The Inquiry was commissioned by the Institutional Investor Council.", "UK firms announce \u00a32.4bn in takeover deals Dealmaking came back with a vengeance today as British companies announced takeover deals involving everything from oil pipes to Maximuscle protein drinks worth a total of \u00a32.4bn. In a sign that companies are starting to spend the mountains of cash they have amassed after two years of hoarding and risk aversion, corporations such as pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, the cleaning products firm Reckitt Benckiser and Yule Catto, the chemicals maker, announced acquisition deals. The American conglomerate General Electric also succeeded in its third attempt to buy the British oil services firm Wellstream for \u00a3800m, further adding to the buoyant mood. The spate of deals pushed the FTSE 100 index up by 47 points, to close just short of a year high at 5860, promising a strong finale to 12 months that have gone down as the worst for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in more than a decade. Rhys Phillip, Ernst & Young's head of M&A for the UK and Ireland, said: \"There is a lot more sentiment in the market for deals now and a lot more conversations taking place because companies have all this money flushing around and are looking for a reason to spend it.\" Among the main deals of the day, Glaxo has agreed to buy Maxinutrition, Europe's biggest sports nutrition company, from Darwin Private Equity for \u00a3162m. Reckitt Benckiser snapped up Paras Pharmaceuticals, an Indian ointments and personal care company, for $726m (\u00a3458m), while Yule Catto acquired PolymerLatex, Europe's third-largest latex maker, for \u20ac433m (\u00a3366m). However, Phillip, who has seen \"steady growth\" in deal activity in the past six months, which he expects to continue, warned that the increase is from a low base and that the recovery has some way to go. \"I am not cracking open the champagne just yet. There is a lot more talk, but not quite so much action,\" he said, in the week after Burberry, J Sainsbury, Smith & Nephew, Kesa Electricals and G4S were all targets of takeover rumours that have yet to materialise. Some 466 of Europe's biggest companies \u2013 the Stoxx Europe 600 index, excluding its financial constituents \u2013 are sitting on $691bn of cash, according to Bloomberg. This represents a 16% increase on the amount they had at the end of 2007 as the financial crisis gained momentum and companies opted to hoard cash by cutting costs, dividends and deal activity. At the same time, it is relatively easy for companies to raise more cash since investor demand for bonds is strong, while the low base rate ensures interest is low. The UK oil services groups Wellstream and PSN also announced that they were being sold, as energy services companies grow increasingly confident about the future after a two-year slump and as the price of oil edges ever closer to $90 a barrel. General Electric has agreed to pay \u00a3800m for Wellstream, the world's biggest maker of flexible pipes used by oil companies in deep water, after its two previous lower offers were rejected. Wood Group, a maker of chokes, valves, pumps and wellhead systems used by companies such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell, said it had agreed to acquire PSN, a Scottish rival, for $955m. The combined \"brownfield\" companies \u2013 which specialise in squeezing oil out of ageing oil and gas fields \u2013 will be called Wood Group PSN. These deals indicate a confidence that the demand for oil \u2013 and therefore its price \u2013 will remain high for the foreseeable future because both companies are concerned with reaching some of the world's less accessible reserves, whether under deep sea or in heavily used wells. The value of mergers and acquisitions completed in the UK this year is on course to be the lowest since 1997, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters. Some $212.5bn worth of deals involving at least one British company had been finalised today, down from $246.1bn in 2009 and less than a quarter of the record $961bn in 2000. The $21.4bn takeover of confectioner Cadbury by Kraft, the US food company, in April was the biggest UK deal completed this year. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite trade union, reiterated his call for the scrutiny of any takeover of a UK company by a foreign business, after it emerged this month that Kraft plans to move parts of Cadbury to Switzerland for tax purposes less than a year after its controversial acquisition of the chocolate maker. \"When companies like Kraft start relocating Cadbury's financial affairs to Switzerland, so that they can avoid paying the tax due for the manufacturing and selling in this country, it is difficult to retain any belief that UK plc benefits at all from how the industrial world operates,\" McCluskey said.", "Stock markets braced for Chinese interest rate rise   China is widely expected to raise its interest rates in the wake of stronger than expected inflation figures released over the weekend. The prospects of such a move could unsettle stock markets, with commodity companies in particular likely to suffer if the country acts to dampen down demand. Inflation jumped from 4.4% in October to a 28-month high of 5.1% in November, compared to forecasts of 4.7%. The increase was driven by an 11.7% jump in food prices. Before the figures were released, China had already acted to tighten monetary policy by increasing the reserve requirements for its banks. This was prompted by stronger than expected trade data released on Friday, which showed Chinese exports rising by 34.9% in November, while imports climbed by 37.7%. But the strong inflation numbers suggested more action was required, said economists. Others suggested the November figure could represent a peak. State radio today reported comments from an annual economic conference confirming a shift from a \"loose\" monetary policy stance to a \"prudent\" one, which seemingly paves the way for a rate rise. \"The priority is to actively and properly handle the relations between maintaining steady and relatively fast economic growth, economic restructuring and managing inflation expectations,\" said a statement from the conference. \"Strategic economic restructuring will be accelerated and stabilising price levels will be given a more prominent position.\" Analysts said the high level of Chinese inflation could lead to higher prices in the UK for goods produced in the country.", "Regional airline Flybe raised \u00a366m from stock market flotation Flybe crowned a turbulent decade that saw it survive the aftermath of 9/11 to become one of Europe's fastest growing regional airlines by raising \u00a366m in a stockmarket flotation. The Exeter-based airline was known as British European when it was heading for serious difficulties in 2002 but it gained a new lease of life by rebranding as Flybe and embracing a low-cost business model under chief executive Jim French. The airline operates from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton and Norwich to nearly 80 destinations in continental Europe and has aggressive expansion plans, having signed a deal this year with Brazil's Embraer to add up to 140 aircraft to its 68-strong fleet. Flybe said half the proceeds from the flotation would be used to fund aircraft deals, with the rest bolstering its cash balance that will not be deployed on a brace of acquisitions - contrary to recent speculation. It is understood that the airline is looking to expand via codeshare deals, which allow it to sell tickets on services operated by other airlines, following deals with Air France and Finnair. French said he was \"very pleased\" that the share offer was two-times oversubscribed, valuing the business at \u00a3215m after it launched at 295p a share. After a day of trading on the grey market, before formal trading begins on Wednesday, the shares closed up 16% at 341.25p. \"We have long seen a listing as an essential step in the growth and development of the business,\" said French. British Airways was the only leading shareholder not to dilute its stake in the offering as it acquired more shares to keep its holding at 15%. BA became an investor after Flybe took over its regional business, BA Connect, in 2007.", "Asian boom fuels record year for floats The amount raised in stockmarket flotations around the world this year is expected to break the 2007 record of $300bn (\u00a3190bn), according to research from accountants Ernst & Young. Asian companies are behind a surge in the number of floats. Britain and Europe have done better than last year, but account for only a tiny proportion of new activity because of fears about the future of the euro and the sovereign debt crisis. In the UK, the change of government, uncertainty over budget cuts and fears of a double dip recession have put off scores of companies from listing on the London Stock Exchange. E&Y says that in the first 11 months of this year, 1,199 companies have raised $255bn ($94.6bn, 2009) with Chinese firms accounting for more than 45% of the value. David Wilkinson, UK IPO leader at E&Y said: \"The IPO market reflects the twin-track global economy with Europe and the US trailing Asia, where GDP is racing ahead. I think next year will be a similar story, with perhaps more action from Latin America, especially Brazil. South America has recovered less quickly from the recession than China and India, but is now rebounding strongly.\" Wilkinson said: \"I am afraid it hasn't been a great year for the UK; shares in only four or five newly floated UK companies are today trading above the price at which they sold their shares to the public, so it's quite a sorry affair. We expected a much brighter picture back in January.\" He was reluctant to make predictions for the British IPO market in 2011, beyond saying there is \"a pipeline of companies waiting to list their shares, but if investors demand knockdown prices, firms may conclude now is not the time to sell.\" E&Y says in the emerging markets, there is still everything to play for with a large number of firms earmarked for privatisation in 2011 and 2012, particularly financial institutions, commodities groups and industrial firms.", "FTSE 100 index has gained 1,000 points since the start of July In the land of housing and building materials, there are also more cheerful noises after the catastrophes of the past two years.

Eagle, who was handed a record fine of \u00a32.8m in May for his part, had wanted to use FEI as an investment vehicle and bought 85% of the company but wanted to sell all but 10% of the stock. To create a market in the shares, he bought the stockbroker SP Bell which sold FEI stock to its clients, generating demand and pushing its price up. Betton instructed SP Bell staff to sell FEI shares to clients. He is the last individual in the affair to be punished. SP Bell has received a public censure and would have been fined had it not gone into liquidation. The tribunal said Betton had personally rolled over 75 trades from client to client \u2013 consisting of at least 340m FEI shares \u2013 allowing them to defer payment for the shares indefinitely. Trading in FEI shares was suspended in July 2004, leaving more than \u00a39m of unsettled trades which neither SP Bell nor its clients could meet. SP Bell ceased trading and went into administration. Margaret Cole, FSA managing director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \"This marks the final chapter of a scheme which saw the share price of Fundamental-E Investments deliberately manipulated to the detriment of ordinary investors.\" Betton, who earned a salary of \u00a375,000 and was not on commission told the Tribunal that he did not know that the purpose of the scheme was to raise FEI's share price artificially and said he had only made a profit of \u00a34,500. In his witness statement he has admitted that his \"response to the unfolding situation was tempered by the fear of being sacked by Mr Eagle\". \"Betton was an experienced director of an FSA authorised firm. He knew that the trading for his clients was artificial and he worked closely with Winterflood and its traders to artificially raise the price of the stock. This betrayed his duty to his clients and as the Tribunal has agreed was damaging to market confidence,\" Cole said.", "Commodities trader Glencore poised for \u00a330bn flotation Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader, plans a flotation next year, although the company has yet to pick London for the listing, the Guardian has learned. Glencore, which could be valued at as much as \u00a330bn, is eyeing stock markets in Asia as an alternative to the London Stock Exchange, as investors favour the booming economies of China and India over moribund western markets. The company declined to comment but City chatter suggests a float may be on the cards. A partial flotation of the business, owned by more than 400 partners, would be aimed at raising cash for acquisitions. The Switzerland-based trader owns one third of UK miner Xstrata, raising speculation that a full bid for the business could be considered. Glencore's revenues have boomed over the past year as commodities such as gold or copper have rocketed, fuelled by strong demand from emerging markets. Investors have also flocked to metals such as gold, avoiding the volatile equity and credit markets in Europe and the US. The company has issued up to $2.2bn (\u00a31.4bn) in convertible bonds to investors in the US, Singapore and China. Revenues soared to $70bn in the first half, from $45bn last year, according to the company's latest accounts. Net profit rose to $1.5bn, from $1.0bn in 2009. The company was able to \"take advantage of the gradual recovery in the global economy and generally higher average commodity prices,\" it said this summer. Founded in 1974 by US trader Marc Rich, Glencore also owns and develops mining projects around the world, including oil exploration and development blocks in West Africa and a Gold mining operation in Kazakhstan. In 1983, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, then a US prosecutor, indicted Rich for tax evasion who sought refuge in Switzerland. Rich was pardoned by president Bill Clinton in 2001. Initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions are returning to the markets after two years of drought, caused by the global credit crunch. The last quarter of this year is on track to become the highest quarter on record for global public flotations (IPOs), according to Dealogic. At present, global IPO volumes stand at $99bn, via 289 deals, Dealogic said. Asia Pacific accounts for 60% of IPOs in the fourth quarter, including offerings from AIA Group or Petronas Chemicals. Morgan Stanley led the November global IPO manager ranking, with deals worth $5.4bn, followed by Goldman Sachs, which led 10 transactions worth $4.2bn, Dealogic reports.", "Promethean World sees shares slump after profits warning Education technology firm Promethean World has cemented its reputation as the worst flotation of 2010 after hitting its shareholders with a profits warning. Promethean World, which makes interactive whiteboards and handheld learner-response systems for students, admitted today that sales have fallen sharply in recent weeks in the face of austerity cutbacks in America and across Europe. With sales in the current quarter now lower than a year ago, the company is on track to miss its revenue targets for this year. Blackburn-based Promethean World blamed \"a deepening of budgetary uncertainties and constraints\" since the end of October, adding that it is hopeful that potential orders have simply been delayed rather than cancelled. But shares in the company crashed by a third, to 52p. They have now lost nearly three-quarters of their value since the company was floated at 200p per share in March. Analysts were scathing about the profits warning. Numis Securities slashed its forecast for 2011 by 50%, pointing out that the company had hoped that Europe would be a growth market. \"Given the issues over scale and rapidity of downgrade, substantial slowdown in the largest market, lack of momentum in the 'new' markets of Europe, we expect investors to be wary and believe it will be a Herculean task for the company to rebuild credibility,\" Numis said. Despite the recent slowdown, Promethean World is still on track to increase revenues by 20% this year. Numis, however, estimates sales are currently declining at \"significant double-digit rates\". The slump in the company's value, from \u00a3400m in March to just \u00a3105m today, will have hurt founder Tony Cann in the pocket as he still has a 40% stake in the business. Apax Partners, the private equity firm, sold its stake during the flotation, which was handled by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Cazenove and Gleacher Shacklock. These three banks received most of the \u00a38.5m fees paid during the float."], "2010-11-B2": ["Shares fall on fears over North Korean attack and Irish bailout Traders said the artillery shelling off the island of Yeonpyeong earlier today, in which two soldiers were killed, had heightened tensions. The South Korean won fell heavily, dropping by 3.5% against the dollar, and the cost of insuring South Korea's government debt jumped by a fifth. \"It is bad news all round this morning... as concerns over the Irish economy and the situation between North and South Korea continue to mount,\"said Yusuf Heusen, senior sales trader at IG Index. \"The uncertainty surrounding the stability of the Irish government has raised fears that the EU bailout could be delayed for some time to come.\" The London stock market saw a burst of selling, with the FTSE 100 index dropping 66 points, or 1.2%, to 5613. Mining stocks led the fallers, along with Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 one of the UK banks most exposed to Ireland's financial sector \u2013 which dropped nearly 3% to 62p at one stage. Spread-betters had expected European stock markets to show small losses this morning, before the exchange of fire between North and South Korea. Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income research at Evolution Securities, warned that many investors are now expecting the weaker members of the eurozone to restructure their debt. \"This latest bout of the crisis gained momentum with the many comments regarding bond holders 'sharing the pain'. When it was clear that these statements were doing damage to the market and undermining confidence various G20 finance ministers published a statement to try and reassure the market that existing debt would not be affected. However it is clear from bond prices that the market does not consider this to be a realistic assessment of the situation. There is just too much outstanding debt,\" Jenkins said. But Spain's five-year CDS rose by 4.5 basis points to 286.5bp, with the Portugese CDS contract rising 10.5bp to 468bp. The difference between the interest rate on Spanish 10-year government debt and its German equivalent also rose today to its highest level since the euro was created - 233 basis points. This followed an auction of Spanish debt in which the country offered higher interest rates to buyers than previously. The dollar, a traditional \"safe-haven\" in turbulent times, rose against other major currencies following the Korean attacks. The euro fell against the dollar, falling more than one cent to $1.3495, from $1.3618.", "UK clearing house LCH.Clearnet spurns \u00a3400m US bid Europe's largest independent clearing house, London-based LCH.Clearnet, has rebuffed a \u00a3400m bid for the company from InterContinental Exchange (ICE). The offer by ICE, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was backed by the Singapore stock exchange and highlights how clearing has become a major new sector for mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the financial crisis. Regulators are drawing up rules that will force almost all derivatives transactions to go through registered exchanges and be processed by clearing houses. The moves are designed to boost transparency in the derivatives market and improve risk management for deals that have traditionally been done over-the-counter (OTC): in other words, in private via brokerages or \"bilaterally\" between individual institutions. Clearing houses act as central counterparties, ensuring that players get their money back if one participant involved in a deal goes bust. Clearers require clients to furnish collateral or \"margin\" to provide a financial cushion for the clearing house so that it can repay debts that turn sour. LCH.Clearnet is controlled by more than 90 shareholders who are also its users \u2013 mostly banks and trading organisations such as the London Metals Exchange. The organisation is believed to have rejected ICE's bid on the grounds that it did not reflect the true value of the clearer. ICE's offer also ran into opposition from LCH.Clearnet's shareholders who feared a takeover could result in higher trading fees from fewer players in the market. \"A higher offer could have brought them round to the negotiating table,\" said one stakeholder. Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, refused to comment on \"bid speculation\" but admitted the upshot of initiatives to put trading in financial instruments such as credit default swaps through registered exchanges and clearing houses would be \"extreme\". He said: \"Just look at the interest rate swap market, where trades today are worth a notional value of $350tn [\u00a3219tn] but only $115tn go through LCH, the rest are traded over-the-counter.\" Liddell said the expanding market will increase competition but bring fees down in the long term as consolidation follows \"proliferation\". ICE serves global markets for agricultural, credit, currency, emissions and energy markets. It also operates three futures exchanges, including the London-based ICE Futures Europe, which hosts daily trading in half of the world's crude and refined oil futures contracts. Two years ago, ICE began to build its clearing house operation in London, but observers believe the Americans want to acquire LCH.Clearnet because building their business organically was too slow a process. The Singaporeans are keen to expand in London and view ICE as a potential ally. Paul Swann, of ICE Clear Europe, said: \"We are likely to see more asset classes go through clearing houses following initiatives announced at the G20 meeting in London last year and the passing of new laws in Washington.\" Analysts say LCH is under pressure as the London Stock Exchange has indicated it plans to set up its own clearing house for cash equities, making it more important than ever that LCH expands into areas that were previously dominated by over-the-counter businesses."]}
