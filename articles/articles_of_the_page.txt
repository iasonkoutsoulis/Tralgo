Reckitt misses out as FTSE jumps more than 100 points The licence expires on 8 October, and analysts believe the company is likely to see generic competition for the products - which account for some 12% of group profits - almost immediately. Credit Suisse, while still positive on the company overall, pointed out the potential effect. The bank said: "Such a large and growing profit pool will not have gone unnoticed - generic companies already have clearance on the active ingredient in Suboxone. Does Reckitt have a 'silver bullet'? We think not. Generic competition we feel sure is both inevitable and likely to be pretty much immediate. We see little that Reckitt can do to offset this - its slow-release technology won't get clearance for three to four years, while brands count for very little (virtually nothing) in this field. [Reckitt's] 2009 results may be impacted by the exact date that generics go live (a one week delay worth £5m to earnings), but it seems inevitable that generics will be in full force by the year end. Thus 2010 forecasts should include the full impact we believe." This 2.57% increase was the best one day performance for the leading index since 24 April and the first time since the end of May that it has been in positive territory three days in a row. Investors took heart from this week's bumper figures from Goldman Sachs and better than expected results from Intel, as well as reasonable US manufacturing and inflation numbers. Even another jump in UK unemployment could not dampen the positive mood, with analysts pointing out that the number of benefit claims grew by less than forecast. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: "The FTSE has had a very positive move higher today, catching quite a few people by surprise in the process and often such moves can be compounded by a sudden rush of investors jumping on board to get in while they can and not miss out on any big move higher. "The rally has been broad based with all sectors benefiting and on some pretty solid volumes too. The rate of unemployment in the UK may have risen higher than expected, making for a grim headline figure, however the rise in claimants was the smallest for a year, which investors took as further indication that the worst is over. "The test for the FTSE will be the resistance seen around 4350-4400 and whilst today's rally is encouraging, [can] the FTSE carry on higher to take out 4500? There's little evidence to show that it can, considering how it has attempted that many times through May and June." "The Ghanaian government has at last given formal approval to the Jubilee Phase 1 Development project following the announcement yesterday from Kosmos [a partner in the field] that it had secured loans to fund its share of development. This is a case of the paperwork catching up with the engineers as the project has been in construction for some time. "The Jubilee field straddles both the Deepwater Tano and West Cape Three Points license blocks offshore Ghana and as result the initial unitisation sees Tullow getting 34.7% of the field but with the potential for stake to change as the field comes on stream and more data becomes available. The 34.7% is slightly below the 37% we had anticipated so, in theory, our fair value for Tullow should reduce by around 25p. As we have a target price of 1200p and the shares are currently trading at [around] 891p it's a trifle academic at this stage especially as the un-risked upside of Tullow's portfolio is substantially higher than our risked fair value target of 1200p."

Company insolvencies jump 27% as high interest rates hit economy; UK grocery price inflation dips – as it happened Grocery price inflation has dropped to 14.9%, still painfully high, while over 2,000 companies collapsed in June Company insolvencies in England and Wales have jumped, as firms are hit by a slow-growing economy and high interest rates. There were 2,163 registered company insolvencies in June, the Insolvency Service reports. That is 27% higher than in the same month in the previous year – 1,698 firms filed for insolvency in June 2022. It is higher than levels seen while the Government support measures were in place in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and also higher than pre-pandemic numbers. But it is a drop on May, when 2,553 insolvencies were reported – a 40% year-on-year surge. Time for a recap. The pressures on households has eased a little, with grocery inflation dropping to its lowest level of this year. “Some commentators have said this may be the peak for mortgage rates, but the UK inflation data for June will be published tomorrow and will be key to what happens next with the pricing of fixed rates. The market is expecting to see inflation fall back in June, but as we’ve seen in the past couple of months, if it remains stubbornly high, and doesn’t fall in line with expectations, this could cause mortgage rates to rise further. ARK, an investor in Elon Musk’s Twitter, has written down their stake in the business by 47% as advertisers rein in their spending on the social media platform. A leading thinktank has said that higher pay increases for public sector workers would not be inflationary. England and Wales are on track for the highest quarterly number of company insolvencies since early 2009, Reuters has spotted. Insolvency Service figures show that over the three months to the end of June, there were 6,403 companies declared insolvent. If this figure is confirmed when official quarterly numbers are published later this month, it would be the highest non-seasonally-adjusted calendar-quarter total since the first quarter of 2009. That shows the struggle businesses are facing to repay Covid-19 loans against a tough economic backdrop, leading to June’s 27% jump. Gareth Harris, a partner at RSM UK Restructuring Advisory, says: “The fall in customer demand, an economic downturn and increased interest rate of 5%, on top of high inflation and the cost of living crisis, has meant businesses and small to medium enterprises (SMEs) have had little time to build a healthy cash reserve or recover from the post-pandemic impact. Many are considering closing or have closed their doors for good, and its crucial government initiatives are introduced quickly to help stem the flow. In a relief to holidaymakers, strikes by nearly 600 DHL workers who work for easyJet at Gatwick have been suspended following an improved pay offer. If the workers reject the deal, fresh strike dates will be announced, it says. However, separate strikes at Gatwick by around 450 ASC, Menzies Aviation and GGS workers are still scheduled to take place from 28 July to 1 August, with a further four days from 4 August to 8 August. Wall Street has opened cautiously: After that flurry of US economic data… the pound is trading flat against the US dollar at $1.3077. That’s not too far from last week’s 15- month high of 1.3144, as traders await tomorrow’s UK inflation report. The CPI index is forecast to drop to 8.2% from 8.7% in May – still four times over the Bank of England’s target, meaning further interest rate increases are likely. “This is not yet fully priced in, so we see room for continued sterling strength.” US industrial production declined by 0.5% in June, the Federal Reserve has reported, in a second piece of disappointing economic data this morning. That’s the second monthly fall in a row, and missing expectations that output would be flat. The Fed reports that manufacturing output dropped by 0.3% in June, while mining dropped by 0.2% and utilities declined 2.6%. Most major market groups posted declines in June, says the Fed, adding: The decrease of 0.9% in the index for consumer nondurables reflected declines in clothing (2.1%), energy (1.8%), and food and tobacco (1.3%). Retail spending across America grew by less than expected last month, data just released shows. US retail sales increased by 0.2% in June, missing expectations of a 0.5% rise, and were 1.5% larger than a year ago. Sales were pulled down by a 1.2% drop at building material and garden equipment and supplies dealers, and a 1.4% drop at gasoline station sales. But underlying retail sales rose by 0.6%. Food services sales increased by a muted 0.1% m/m which, together with the drop back in building materials sales, could reflect the impact of wildfire smoke, which kept people inside across large swathes of the Northeast. The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that global economic activity is slowing, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and that medium-term growth prospects remain weak. But, she says, there are concerning “divergences in economic fortunes across countries” – with some pockets of the global economy doing well, others weakening, and vulnerable countries falling further behind. She adds: Georgieva also urged central banks not to let-up in the fight against inflation, saying: A premature celebration can reverse the hard-won gains made so far in the disinflation process. “Firms across nearly all sectors are facing multiple ongoing challenges: rising interest rates, stagnant inflation, the ongoing impact of Brexit and Covid, labour shortages, and soaring costs. Many business leaders will no doubt already be having difficult conversations about whether they can continue to operate at all, let alone profitably – and we are seeing the impact of that in the late and failed payment claims, which peaked in Q1 of this year. Back in the City, shares in cybersecurity firm Darktrace have surged by 20% after reporting its finances have been given a clean bill of health. EY has now submitted that report, and Darktrace says it does not believe it has any impact on previously filed public company financial statements. The company says: It also says the UK’s auditing watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, has inspected its audits, without any “key findings arising”. Shares in Darktrace jumped by up to 25%, to the highest level of this year. The stock is now trading around 350p a share, sharply higher than its IPO price of 250p where it began trading on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. However, Darktrace still has a long way to go to reclaim the highs from October 2021 at around 945p.” Guardian Newsroom: Can the UK avoid a recession? There were 1,759 CVLs, which is 21% higher than in June 2022; 260 were compulsory liquidations, which is 77% higher than June 2022; 14 were CVAs, which is 75% higher than June 2022; There were 130 administrations, which is 44% higher than June 2022. We have now caught up with the Covid backlog – that is the so-called ‘zombie companies’ that were able to avoid insolvency during the pandemic partly or wholly due to the Covid government support measures, and which subsequently needed to liquidate when the support ran out. This boosted numbers for a while, but it looks as if they have now been processed. So today’s high rates reflect the current financial pressures, including high interest rates and high inflation. Businesses that levered up on low interest rates will need to adjust their business models to cope with a sustained period of higher interest rates, which is forecast to last at least into 2024. If they can’t do that, they face some difficult choices and it seems likely that restructuring and insolvency activity will remain high for the foreseeable. The recent restructuring plans for Fitness First, Prezzo and Chaptre Finance are “clear examples of this,” West says. They are now managing higher borrowing costs and cost inflation, alongside wider economic factors. It’s inevitable not all will survive, especially those in consumer facing sectors. This week’s inflation figures will be watched with great intent. There were 260 compulsory liquidations in June 2023, which is 77% higher than in June 2022. The Insolvency Service say:

Pound on track for best week this year despite recession worries; Gatwick strikes called – as it happened Strike action involving baggage handlers and check-in staff will “inevitably” cause severe delays, disruption and cancellations, Unite union says Nearly a thousand workers are set to take eight days of strike action at Gatwick Airport in July and August in a dispute over pay, which unions say will disupt the summer holiday getaway. The Unite union has announced that 950 staff working for ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services Ltd will take part in a four-day strike from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August, and a second four-day strike from Friday 4 August to Tuesday 8 August. All four companies conduct outsourced operations for major airlines, including ground handling, baggage handling and check in agents roles. Given the scale of the industrial action, disruption, delays and cancellations are inevitable across the airport, Unite says. They have had every opportunity to make our members’ a fair pay offer but have chosen not to do so.” That’s all for another week – here are today’s main stories: And do check out our investigation into addiction in the gaming industry: Despite an underwhelming day’s trading today, Britain’s blue-chip share index has just posted its best week since the spring. Today it lost 5 points, in a rather dreary session. But its weekly gain is the best since the last week of March. Stocks have been lifted by optimism that America is winning in its battle against inflation, after the CPI index rose by 3% in the year to June. The National Centre for Gaming Disorders (NCGD), which had its first patient in 2020, was originally given NHS funding based on seeing just 50 people a year. But the specialist London clinic has been treating 30 people a month since the end of March this year – more than seven times anticipated demand – taking the total to 855. She explains: The desperation of the families trying to address the disruption that gaming harms have had on their children is extreme. I was not prepared for what we came across, with violence within the home and refusal to go to school being prominent. Some of the companies whose Gatwick workers will strike later this month and in August have said they will continue to work towards a pay deal. “This pay award relates to our 2023 pay review and is in addition to the 10% increase awarded in 2022. “We are in continued discussions with our airline partners and remain committed to seeking a resolution. “We have invited Unite to return to the table to continue discussions and hope to be able to reach an agreement which is workable for both the business and our employees.” “We will continue to work to pursue an agreeable solution to protect service to our airline and airport partners and their customers.” “However, we continue to work closely with Unite to reach a satisfactory conclusion for all parties.” Subsiding inflation has helped to push US consumer sentiment to the highest level in nearly two years this month. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer morale has jumped 72.6 this month, the highest reading since September 2021, compared to 64.4 in June. Consumers grew more optimistic about current economic conditions, and the outlook for the economy, although poorer Americans didn’t share the uptick in morale. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu says: The US dollar has weakened this week, on expectations that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates in 2024, after a series of hikes in 2022 and 2023. While expectations remain high that the FOMC will hike this month that hike is likely the last and market participants have increased positioning for rate cuts in 2024. Expectations that interest rates will rise faster in the UK than the US in the coming months have put the pound on track for its best week of the year. Sterling has gained around three cents this week, rising from $1.2836 to a 15-month high over $1.314 earlier today. That’s the strongest week since November 2022, and a gain of 2.2% against the US dollar since Monday morning. But with UK inflation expected to remain over 8% in June, the Bank of England is forecast to raise Bank Rate to 6% by December, from 5% today. This week’s rally has come despite concerns that the UK economy could have contracted in the second quarter of 2023, after GDP fell by 0.1% in May. He notes that the hundreds of job cuts are just “the first” of a “series of changes” (insiders expect thousands of workers to be made redundant worldwide). Earlier this year, we announced a three-year productivity programme to transform our ways of working, reduce complexity and make us more cost conscious. In an ever-changing world, we can’t stand still. We know we need to go beyond and constantly adapt and evolve, so we stay ahead of our competitors and continue to be a leader in consumer health. When we created Haleon, we did what mattered most and prioritised business continuity so we could deliver for our consumers and customers. But today, we know that life at Haleon can feel complicated and slow. We need to make changes to our organisation so we can operate with speed and agility. This week, we began to make changes to how we are organised. Colleagues who are impacted have already been informed and you’ll hear more from leaders in the coming weeks, allowing for consultation periods in some markets. We know that change is unsettling, particularly when accompanied by media coverage which can create more anxiety and raise more questions. The changes we are proposing have not been made lightly. I do believe, however, that they are critical for our company to set us up for success for years to come. I can assure you that all changes have been well considered and will be thoughtfully implemented. They are the first of a series of changes across our business that we will make to improve how we perform and enable more growth. Thank you. Brian. Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters it was “not for me to dictate to private companies what pay they set their staff” and added it was up to the businesses involved to decide “what is appropriate”. They pointed out that private sector wages had risen by between 5-7% over the past year - in line with the offers made to public sector workers on Thursday. There is also industrial action planned or already underway across Europe, as this factbox from Reuters shows: EUROCONTROL BELGIUM FRANCE Ryanair, which has asked the European Commission to protect overflights from strike disruption, cancelled more than 900 flights in June mainly due to French ATC strikes. ITALY Talking to Italian media, Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said the companies and workers would meet the following week to continue negotiations. Air traffic control company ENAV has confirmed there will be no strikes in the Italian air transport sector between July 27 and Sept. 5 due to a summer exemption provided for in the industry regulations.

Pound hits 15-month high as UK GDP shrinks in May; sickness threat to economy – business live Rolling coverage of the UK GDP report for May, and the Office for Budget Responsibility’s latest report on the public finances The pound has hit a fresh 15-month high this morning, after the UK economy shrank by less than expected in May. Sterling traded at $1.306 against the US dollar for the first time since April 2022, up 0.5%. The rally follows this morning’s GDP report showing a smaller contraction than feared in May despite the extra bank holiday to mark King Charles’ coronation and ongoing strikes. The pound has gained almost 8% against the dollar this year, lifted by the prospect of rising interest rates to cool inflation. GBPUSD is in the green this morning, trading above the key $1.30 handle and the pound is also higher against the euro.” With the pound trading firmly over $1.31 for the first time since April 2022, it’s time to wrap up. Here are today’s main stories, firstly on this morning’s GDP report: ….the state of the UK public finances… …The cooling housing market: And also: Government bonds are also strengthening, on the back of signs that US inflation pressures are easing. The yield, or interest rate, on five-year UK government bonds has dropped to its lowest since 29 June at 4.568% (yields fall when prices rise). Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has declared that the UK will match the US, Germany and France and get inflation down. That means that if we accept the independent pay review body recommendations, we cannot fund it with extra borrowing which pumps more inflationary demand into the economy. Hence our decision today: to accept the pay review body recommendations (one of the biggest cash increases in public sector pay packets ever), and fund it not by borrowing but by finding savings in department budgets. That means finding an additional £2bn this year and £3bn next year from department budgets to fund today's decision, and I am grateful to my Cabinet colleagues for engaging to make this possible. (UK inflation was 8.7% in May, four times over the Bank of England’s target of 2%) The company behind Sensodyne toothpaste, Centrum vitamins and Panadol painkillers plans widespread layoffs in the UK and around the world a year after being spun off from Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker GSK, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports. Weybridge-based Haleon, which has 24,000 staff across 170 countries, plans to cut hundreds of roles in the UK and potentially thousands worldwide, the Guardian understands. The company is one of the world’s biggest consumer healthcare groups and sells over-the-counter drugs, vitamins and oral care products. Staff were briefed on the redundancies this week in a series of meetings and a consultation process, which started on Wednesday, will close on 25 August. Some people will be offered other roles within the company. Those who are laid off are expected to leave Haleon in September. The euro has also rallied against the dollar. The single currency has gained 0.5% to $1.1195, its strongest level since the end of February 2022. And against a basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped to a new 15-month low this afternoon. The dollar continues to weaken after today’s drop in US PPI wholesale inflation, on top of yesterday’s fall in consumer price inflation (CPI) to 3%. Sterling is on track for its 6th daily gain against the US dollar in a row, which would be its best run since last December. The pound has rallied from $1.27 a wek ago to $1.31 today, as traders have calculated that UK interest rates will keep rising this year, while US rates could be near their peak. Sterling has continued to climb against the US dollar, following that fall in US wholesale inflation just reported. The pound has just hit $1.31 for the first time since April 2022, adding to its earlier gains, up around a cent today. Back in the UK, the government has paid a hefty price to borrow in the financial markets today. The real yield is the highest for any index-linked gilt sold via syndication since these sales began in 2005, although more regular auctions have seen higher yields, most recently in October 2022 when markets were shaken by former prime minister Liz Truss’ “mini budget”. Just in: Price pressures across the US economy relaxed last month, in a sign that inflation is easing. US producer price inflation, which measures what goods makers and service providers charge, fell to just 0.1% per year in June. That’s down from 0.9% year-on-year in May, and 11.2% in June 2022 when companies were hiking prices at a hot pace. This fall in wholesale inflation should feed through to consumers in coming weeks and months. Over in the US, the number of people filing new unemployment claims has dropped. There were 237,000 fresh ‘initial claims’ for jobless support last week, down from 249,000 a week earlier, and lower than expected. This implies American firms are continuing to hold onto staff, despite the pressure from rising interest rates… Millions of public sector workers to get pay rise of around six per cent, the UK government has decided, but the increases must (somehow) be found from within existing budgets. Rishi Sunak is asking public-sector trade unions to end the strikes that have weighed on the economy in recent months, saying the offer is final. The teaching unions have said they will recommend the deal to their members, meaning strikes can be called off. Senior government figures are understood to have been concerned about the effects of the pay boost on stubbornly high inflation. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, ruled out providing any extra money funded through borrowing. The move will leave departments facing difficult decisions about how to reallocate spending, with potential knock-on effects for frontline services cuts. The Treasury had budgeted for pay rises of about 3.5%, meaning between £3bn and £5bn will need to be found across Whitehall to make up the shortfall… Over in the high court, a judge has quashed legal changes brought by the government to let agency staff fill in for striking workers. It’s a victory for a group of unions, including Aslef, the RMT and Unite, who joined in legal challenges to “strike-breaking” regulations announced last summer by the government as it faced widespread industrial action across rail and other sectors. “It was entirely counterproductive as rather than weaken industrial action it has hardened attitudes and unnecessarily extended strikes. This ill-thought out, divisive legislation must be consigned to the dustbin of history.” The UK’s public finances are in a “very risky period” after a series of major shocks that have driven the nation’s borrowing costs to rise at the fastest rate in the G7, the Treasury’s tax and spending watchdog has warned. It said the government faced a “number of challenges” in meeting Rishi Sunak’s target to get the national debt falling as a share of national income within five years’ time. Despite promises made by successive Conservative-led governments to reduce Britain’s debt pile, the OBR said the objective was only achieved in three out of the last 12 years – and by a relatively small 3.4 percentage points in total. In a downbeat assessment in its latest fiscal risks report, the OBR said other governments were also facing heightened pressure on their public finances from rising global interest rates pushing up the cost of servicing debt. However, it warned the UK had the highest level of inflation-linked debt among G7 economies, making it more vulnerable to shocks, with debt interest costs rising in the UK at twice the pace of any country in the club of advanced economies between 2019 and 2022. “This is a watershed moment. IPPR research also shows that sickness is harming earnings, driving millions out of the labour market, and blocking economic justice across the country. On the flipside, these challenges represent opportunities – if the right policies, and political courage, can be found. “If we want prosperity for all, we must deliver good health for all. We call on ministers to commit to a health equivalent of net-zero – a 30-year commitment to make the UK the healthiest country in the world. That means a bold agenda for NHS reform, but also putting in place the foundations of a healthy life: better housing, top quality education and good work.” The OBR has also highlighted that the UK has had the second-highest burden of disease in the G7 after the US since 1990. Today’s Fiscal Risks report shows that the UK has the lowest healthy life expectancy at birth of any major developed economy bar the US, and had a slower rate of progress over the 2010s than all apart from the US and Canada. Improvements have stalled across most countries since 2010, and the disease burden rose slightly in the US, Canada and the UK in the years immediately prior to the pandemic, the report says. The OBR points out that the UK has persistently higher mortality rates from cancers and respiratory diseases than other advanced economies, and higher rates of adult obesity than Germany, France, Italy and Japan, Adverse shocks to the UK’s financial health seem to have become “more frequent, severe, and costly,” the Office for Budget Responsibility warns today. Today’s Fiscal Risk report says the UK has been hit by a succession of shocks – the Covid pandemic, the energy and cost-of-living crisis, and the sudden interest rate rises in 2022. They have proved twice as costly as all similar shocks in the second half of the last century. It says: If such shocks were to be repeated into the future, this could add a further 125 per cent of GDP to the already unsustainable levels of debt implied by the above baseline dynamics taking debt to 435 per cent of GDP by the mid-2070s.

FTSE 100 marks best day of 2023 as US inflation falls to 3% ‘Not too early to start chilling the champagne,’ says one analyst as traders toast drop in consumer inflation  Copper producer Antofagasta led the risers, jumping by 5.5%, followed mining giant Glencore (+4.87%), packaging firm Smurfit Kappa (+4.9%) and electrical products distributor RS Group (+4.5%). City traders were cheered by the news that US consumer prices rose by 3% in the year to June, the slowest inflation rate in more than two years, down from 4% in May. As the dollar declined, the pound hit $1.30 for the first time since April 2022. Easing US inflation figures lifted hopes that past increases in interest rates were succeeding in cooling prices. That could mean America’s central bankers may finally pause their increases in borrowing costs soon, easing fears that they would trigger a recession to fight inflation. The drop in US inflation in June can largely be attributed to a fall in energy prices, which fell by 16.7% over the last year, with gas prices falling by 26.5%. Annual core US inflation, which strips out food and energy, cooled to 4.8% from 5.3% in May. This measure is closely watched by policymakers. Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, said there was “nothing not to like” in the US inflation report. “Shelter [housing] inflation decelerated as expected, services ex-shelter rose at less than a 2% annualised rate, and core goods prices were down due to slightly lower used-car prices that are likely to decline further through year-end,” Temple said. “It’s too early to pop the champagne, but it’s not too early to start chilling the bottle,” Temple advised. The US dollar fell by 1% to a 15-month low against a basket of currencies, on expectations that US interest rates could be near their peak. George Saravelos, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said it was time to sell the dollar. “First, we feel increasingly confident that the US disinflation process is well under way … Second, the disinflation process looks increasingly benign,” Saravelos said The US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold in June, after raising them 10 times in a row since March 2022. It meets again later this month, with some analysts suspecting it might make its final rise of the current cycle at its July meeting. Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion “There’s no denying that at 3% June’s CPI number is the smallest year-on-year increase since March 2021 and that all-important core number also fell back significantly,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. “But despite the cautious optimism evident from market reaction it seems unlikely the Fed will be swayed enough to change course just yet.” Analysts at ING said: “The Federal Reserve seems intent on pushing ahead with a July rate hike, but the need for additional tightening thereafter is questionable.” The Bank of England, though, is expected to raise interest rates from 5% to 6% by the end of 2023. European stock markets also rallied, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC both up by about 1.5%. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 share index hit hits highest level since April 2022. The FTSE 100 has had a volatile year. After hitting a record high of more than 8,000 points in February it has fallen back, and has lagged behind other main indices during 2023. The index has rallied back to where it began for 2023, while the S&P 500 has gained 16% this year. Government bonds also recovered some of their recent losses, on hopes that inflation was being tamed in the US. This pulled down the yields, or interest rates, on short-term UK and US bonds, which hit 15-year highs last week. “Today’s inflation numbers won’t have altered the calculus around [0.25 percentage points] US rate hike in two weeks’ time, however the direction of travel when it comes to the wider trend suggests it could be the last one in the current rate hiking cycle,” said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. “It is this shift that markets are reacting to, with yields falling sharply in the US, as well as here in the UK.”

A million UK households face £500 rise in monthly mortgage payments; US inflation drops to 3% – as it happened The governor of the Bank of England said there “will be consequences” of higher interest rates on borrowers, as nearly one million mortgage holders could see their monthly repayments increase by about £500 in the next three years. Andrew Bailey said at the press conference following the Bank’s latest Financial Stability Report: What we are seeking to do here… is balance having the transmission of monetary policy with – the two things that I would emphasise – the resilience of the banking system, and the ability to support customers and therefore manage the consequences of this. But there will be consequences from increased interest rates I’m afraid because that, from a monetary policy perspective, is why we have to do it. A quick thought on the Bank of Canada rate hike from Stephen Brown, deputy chief north America economist: Unlike in June, the decision to hike was correctly anticipated by the majority of forecasters and markets were pricing in an 80% chance of the move. The accompanying policy statement did not provide any explicit forward guidance, but the tone was hawkish. It noted that “while the Bank expects consumer spending to slow in response to the cumulative increase in interest rates, recent retail trade and other data suggest more persistent excess demand in the economy”, while highlighting that strong immigration is initially putting upward pressure on activity and prices before any beneficial effect of reduced labour shortages is felt. Indeed, the Bank reiterated that “with three-month rates of core inflation running around 3½-4% since last September, underlying price pressures appear to be more persistent than anticipated.” Reflecting those concerns, the Bank upgraded its forecasts for both GDP and inflation in the new Monetary Policy Report. It now expects quarterly GDP growth to average about 1% annualised for the next four quarters, well below the economy’s potential of nearer 2% but significantly better than the consensus forecast of a mild recession. The Bank has pushed back its assumption for when headline inflation will reach 2.0% to mid-2025, although its forecasts for inflation of 2.9% in Q4 2023 and 2.2% in Q4 2024 show it still expects significant improvement before then. In terms of inflation at least, we think the Bank is taking a glass half-empty approach. Its own surveys imply that capacity and labour shortages have now mostly returned to pre-pandemic norms, while inflation expectations have eased considerably and should continue to decline as actual inflation falls. Despite the Bank’s hawkish bias and continued concern that “that progress towards the 2% target could stall”, we expect a further slowdown in GDP growth and evidence of easing core inflation to persuade the Bank to keep policy on hold over the rest of the year. The payments of more than 1 million borrowers are likely to rise by more than twice that amount by the end of 2026. The UK’s largest banks are strong enough to weather a £125bn financial hit during a severe economic downturn, despite facing mounting stress from rising interest rates, according to the Bank of England. Price rises for US goods and services hit a two-year low in June, a sign that inflation is continuing to ease as the economy responds to the US Federal Reserve’s rapid increases in interest rates. Stock markets have rallied on the news, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on Wall Street hitting new 15-month highs, while European markets are all up more than 1%. Our other stories: The Bank of Canada has raised its key rate by a quarter point to 5%, the highest in 22 years. The move had been expected by economists. It expects inflation stay around 3% for the next year before gradually declining to its 2% target in mid-2025, six months later than previously thought. More reaction to the slowdown in US inflation and what it means for interest rates. Marc Ostwald, chief economist & global strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said: Powell said at the June meeting that the committee sees further hikes this year, which means this month is likely, but will today’s data change their view? I suspect not, but it should. Employment is not as strong as it was and inflation is cooling, rates are over 5%, and painful lags of past hikes are likely still to come. Keeping going because you told the market in the past that you would is not a good rationale for raising rates. Here is our full story on US inflation: The prices of US goods and services hit a two-year low in June, a sign that inflation is continuing to ease as the economy responds to the US Federal Reserve’s rapid increases in interest rates. Even though inflation has continued to go down, price increases still remain higher than the Fed’s 2% annual target rate, meaning more interest rate hikes could come. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indices on Wall Street have both hit 15-month highs. The Nasdaq jumped 170 points, or 1.2%, to 13,932, while the S&P 500 rose 40 points, or 0.9%, to 4,480, their highest levels since April last year. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street. The Dow Jones has climbed 220 points to 34,479, a 0.6% gain, after the better than expected inflation data. US inflation slowed to an annual rate of 3% in June from 4% in May. The rise in the headline index was also 0.2%, as modest rebounds in gasoline and energy services prices resulted in a 0.6% m/m rebound in overall energy prices. But the sharp downward trend in food inflation continued, with food at home prices unchanged on the month. Base effects pushed the headline CPI inflation rate down from 4.0% to a 27-month low of 3.0%, as the last of the big rises in energy prices in the first half of 2022 dropped out. Turning to core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, he said: The downward trend in shelter inflation continued, with CPI rent rising by 0.5% again but the larger owners’ equivalent rent index up by only 0.4%. There were also signs that gains in core services excluding housing are slowing. Although that was largely due to an 8.1% m/m plunge in airfares, which mainly reflects lower jet fuel prices rather than labour market conditions, it is nevertheless the sector Fed officials are watching most closely as they look for evidence the slowdown in core inflation will continue. Here in the UK, inflation is running at 7.9%. The Bank of England will be jealous. Nevertheless, core inflation remains high, and [Fed chief Jerome] Powell is likely to continue on his course to squeeze inflation by raising rates at the FOMC’s next meeting. The US labour market remains tight, with high employment numbers and consistent wage rises, while the country’s housing market is showing remarkable resilience – all adding to the expectations of a further interest rate hike in late July. Markets seem to have priced in the newest inflation data, and we don’t expect any major moves as a result of the latest figures. US futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street in 45 minutes’ time. The price for gold has become more interesting and bullish on the back of the US CPI data, as traders don’t expect the Fed to chop more wood now. The bitcoin price has become more interesting as well, and we have seen a jump in prices. Overall, we think this is the best news for the markets so far this year when it comes to the US CPI data. NEWSFLASH: Inflation in the US has slowed more than expected to 3% in June, the lowest rate since 2021. The annual inflation rate fell from 4% in May, according to government figures. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy costs that tend to be volatile, was also lower than expected at 4.8%, while economists had expected a rise to 5%.

Nvidia in talks to be anchor investor in Arm flotation, say reports Semiconductor powerhouse could invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Cambridge-based firm Nvidia, which is riding high on demand from artificial intelligence (AI) companies for its products, was forced to pull out of a $66bn (£51bn) deal to buy Arm last year. Anchor investors typically buy shares at an agreed price before an IPO begins, to enhance the stability of an offering and reassure potential investors. The FT reported that the flotation could take place in New York as soon as September. Ben Barringer, an analyst at the wealth management company Quilter Cheviot, said Arm’s status as a “crucial” player in the technology sector made interest in the IPO from companies such as Nvidia likely. “Having [Arm] controlled by one industry player was never going to work and thus having anchor investors helps to alleviate that problem. It is unlikely one company will be a dominant anchor investor,” he said. “Following this news, watch the moves from Apple and Microsoft. Apple is Arm’s biggest customer and as such will want influence in order to secure its supply.” Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Arm and Nvidia declined to comment.

Rising mortgage rates will cause ‘financial stress’, MPs hear, as two-year fixed rates hit 15-year high – as it happened Treasury Committee quiz lenders about mortgage rates, as two-year fixed mortgage rate rises to 6.66%, highest since 2008 Over in parliament, MPs on the Treasury Committee are starting to question mortgage providers on rising rates, house prices and forbearance. Here’s what to expect, from the committee: The Committee will question mortgage providers on consumer behaviour following recent rate rises, the impact on house prices and the wider housing market, and mortgage affordability and availability. Government support schemes and the recently agreed ‘mortgage charter’ are also likely to be discussed, as are buy-to-let mortgages and the rental market, and the take-up of long-term fixed rate deals. Here’s the panel: Andrew Asaam, Homes Director, Lloyds Banking Group Bradley Fordham, Mortgage Director, Santander UK Charlotte Harrison, Interim CEO (Home Financing), Skipton Building Society Henry Jordan, Home Commercial Director, Nationwide Nigel Terrington, Chief Executive, Paragon Banking Group Time for a recap. UK borrowers continue to be hit by rising interest rates as the fight against inflation continues, and there may be more pain ahead. Average two-year mortgage rate have risen over their peak last autumn, averaging 6.66% today for the first time in 15 years. MPs have heard that rising mortgage rates are causing financial stress to customers, and that the situation will worsen. However, lenders also reported that they have not seen a significant pick-up in arrears yet. He said mortgage customers coming off deals and going onto new ones were seeing payment increases of “over £200 per month”. The financial markets are anticipating that UK interest rates will hit 6% by November, up from 5% at present. The latest labour market report has shown that UK wages increased at a faster rate than expected in May. Earnings growth hit 7.3% in the three months to May compared with a year earlier, driven by the strongest rise in private sector pay growth outside the pandemic period of 7.7%, the Office for National Statistics said. It was the joint highest since modern records began in 2001. And with unemployment rising, number of job vacancies down, jobs growth slowing and more people looking for work, there are signs that the UK labour market is starting to slow. And in other news… Britain’s debt-laden “zombie” companies are expected to be wiped out by the surge in interest rates, an insolvency specialist has predicted. Morrissey has written to Jet2holidays urging the tour operator to drop its association with marine parks that continue to use captive orcas and dolphins for entertainment. Deutsche Bank have predicted that the Bank of England will lift interest rates by half a percentage point next month. Previously, Deutsche had forecast a quarter-point rise, from 5% to 5.25%. But following this morning’s strong labour market data, showing wage growth running at 7.3%, it has upped its forecasts for the next meeting of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee. Over in Moscow, the central bank has reported that Russia’s current account surplus shrank by 85% in the first half of this year, to $20.2bn. That’s a sharp fall on the record surplus of $147.6bn in January-June 2022, when Russia profited from the surge in energy prices and also cut its imports due to sanctions imposed by the West. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation said the drop in the surplus this year was due to a fall in volumes of exports, and lower prices for oil and gas, and other Russian commodities. On a quarterly basis, the current account balance decreased to $5.4bn in April-June, down from $14.8bn in January-March. Reuters adds that oil and gas revenues, the lifeblood of Russia’s economy, fell 47% year-on-year in January-June, which the finance ministry put down to lower prices for Urals crude and lower natural gas export volumes. Meanwhile in Brazil, inflation has dropped to its lowest level in almost three years. Annual inflation in Latin America’s largest economy slowed to 3.16% in June from 3.94% in May. On a monthly basis, prices fell – by 0.08% – the first deflation registered since September of last year. This may encourage Brazil’s central bank to consider cutting interest rates from their current six-year high of 13.75%…. Rate cut expectations are gaining momentum as Brazil's annual inflation reaches its lowest point in almost three years. Britain’s debt-laden “zombie” companies are expected to be wiped out by the surge in interest rates, an insolvency specialist has predicted. Begbies Traynor, a business recovery and financial consultancy, has said all of the nation’s zombies – companies struggling to service debts that have avoided bankruptcy through cheap borrowing costs – will have failed by the end of next year. “Over the next 18 months, we’ll see virtually all of them finally come to an end,” Ric Traynor, the executive chairman of the company, which is seen as a bellwether for the health of UK businesses, told Bloomberg. Cathryn Ross has said that Thames Water is looking at using smart meters to charge households for excessive water consumption in order to curb the use of hosepipes. She has taken aim at those with big gardens who “think that they care less about their water bills”. The CEO explained: So what we are looking at now we are pushing ahead with the smart meter roll out, could we look at tariff innovation that charged a set amount up to 100 litres of water per person per day, maybe a bit more for 110 120 let’s say, and then if you’re using more than 130 we can start charging you really much more, that might send signals about more efficient water usage”. She added: Back at the London Assembly Environment Committee, Thames Water’s CEO has warned that water supplies are at risk in London due to climate breakdown. It simply is not capable of delivering the resilience that people want today in the 21st century.” She said “numerous parts of the network” face a cocktail of problems and it is “not as resilient as we would like it to be”. This percentage will surely rise given today’s Committee panellists’ discussing averages of £235 increases on monthly mortgage repayments due to large interest rises and deals coming to an end, which on top of a crippling cost of living crisis, consistently high energy prices and rampant inflation explains why many people feel their financial resilience is being pushed to the limit.” “In addition, there was little encouragement for first time buyers today, who it appears need to spend longer amassing a larger deposit or tap into the Bank of Mum and Dad (which isn’t an option for everyone), and then also choose from a narrower portfolio of smaller properties in order to meet monthly mortgage payments and pass banks affordability stress tests.” “But the fact of the matter is that the Tories have inflicted households with a mortgage bombshell, let renters down and failed to build the homes we need. “Millions are feeling the pain from this Tory economic failure. “Labour has a plan to start fixing this crisis. We would stop households missing out on the mortgage support they need by making measures mandatory, we will give greater rights and protections to renters, and we will take the tough choices to get Britain building.” He told MPs on the Treasury committee: “We’d expect some further slight falls to around about 6.5%, would be our expected peak movement.” But, he doesn’t believe this is having a material impact on the number of customers in negative equity, saying: Andrew Asaam from Lloyds Banking Group told MPs house price falls could leave some mortgage holders in negative equity (owing more than their property is worth). But MP also heard there is less risk than in previous financial crisis, as loan-to-value rates are relatively low. “It’s a completely individual situation, but we still think owning a home for most people is better than renting. “And therefore we want to keep products available at higher LTVs for first-time buyers. “But we need to make sure that those first-time buyers are resilient, ie they can afford to stay in their homes through a two-year period where house prices might be falling, for example, and they are aware that they could end up in negative equity.”

Tory MP’s £500,000 stock portfolio raises questions about blind trust system Exclusive: Disclosures about ex-minister Jonathan Djanogly turn spotlight on controversial mechanism used to buy shares A Conservative MP and former minister is listed in shareholder registers as personally owning stakes in companies worth nearly £500,000, raising questions about the effectiveness of the controversial parliamentary “blind trust” system used to buy the shares. Jonathan Djanogly, the MP for Huntingdon, holds shares in Lloyds Bank worth more than £180,000, has an investment worth £120,000 in the housebuilding company Persimmon and a stake worth almost £80,000 in Sainsbury’s. He has smaller stakes in six other companies including the energy supplier Centrica. Djanogly’s current shareholdings have not been publicly declared in parliamentary registers because, he says, they are held in a blind trust, a key mechanism used by ministers to distance themselves from their financial interests. Blind trusts have been used by politicians, predominantly ministers, to allow them to continue to have investments while holding roles that could create a conflict between their private interests and their public duties. They involve moving investments into the hands of trustees, who independently manage a politician’s assets – without their knowledge. Shares, for example, could be bought and sold without any instruction or knowledge of the politician. In the case of shares, the standard practice is that the trustees become the legal owners of the investments and will act on behalf of the politician. Parliamentary guidelines on blind trusts say MPs can give “general directions” about the sort of investments they would like to be made when the trust is set up. MPs may want the trustees to take a cautious approach with investments, or be open to more risk. Politicians can receive reports on the trust’s overall performance and may also have the investments sold if they require cash from the liquidated assets, so their investments are not locked away while in the blind trust. Ministers do not always move their shares into a blind trust. Depending on advice from officials, they may keep them or sell them. Blind trusts are used by nine ministers including by Rishi Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. They involve moving shares owned prior to ministerial office into a trust run by an independent fund manager, who handles the investments on behalf of the beneficiary. MPs do not have to declare shares held in blind trusts, and Djanogly said he had made “all appropriate declarations”. He said he created the blind trust after he became a justice minister in 2010, and as a result none of the shares identified by the Guardian “were bought by me. Nor was the purchase nor my continued holding of them discussed between me and my managers.” But the fact that Djanogly’s holdings are listed in shareholder registers under his own name and at an address owned jointly with his father suggests the trust cannot be truly “blind”. Companies regularly correspond with their shareholders to provide information about shareholder meetings, dividend payments and performance updates. Djanogly did not dispute that the shares were in his name but said he did not pick up post from the property to which information about the shareholdings would have been sent. The findings raise questions about much-criticised blind trust arrangements and whether they truly protect ministers with personal assets and wealth from real and perceived conflicts of interest. When an MP or minister holds shares in a blind trust, they do not need to publicly disclose their existence, even if they are over the £70,000 threshold after which an MP is normally obliged to register them. Campaigners say this creates a transparency black hole. Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting practice at Sheffield University management school, told the Guardian: “The difficulties with the blind trust is it isn’t publicly registered. We don’t know who created it, who the trustee is, how the accountability works. “To exist as a blind trust we have to know it is properly functioning with appropriate Chinese walls between the beneficiary/settlor and the manager … But without that full disclosure of who is doing what, for who, how and when, we can’t be sure the blind trust is effective. Knowing these things is critical if blind trusts are to continue to be a part of our political system.” Djanogly registered shareholdings in FTSE 100 companies in the past including Barclays, Lloyds, Shell and Tesco in 2002. He kept his shares on his register of interests until 2010 when he became a minister and moved them into a blind trust. Dr Daniel Beizsley, a Spotlight on Corruption policy consultant, said: “Blind trusts can only work if MPs are truly ‘blind’ to their contents. If MPs are able to track the performance of their financial interests from company disclosures then this is clearly not the case.” Since last October, Djanogly has been on the public accounts committee. Any awareness by Djanogly of his shareholdings could risk a conflict of interest given that the committee scrutinises government expenditure and regularly deals with matters concerning commercial companies. For example, the committee is currently reviewing progress on the emergency services network, which is using network infrastructure from EE, part of BT Group. Djanogly has questioned officials working on the project. He has shares worth more than £40,000 in the company. “I maintain that I have made all appropriate declarations to the register of members’ interests and the public accounts committee,” he said. He added that he was “taking advice on what I do or do not need to declare” now that he had been made aware of the fuller details of his financial interests.

Tube train drivers to join strikes in late July; EasyJet cancels 1,700 flights, blaming Gatwick delays – as it happened Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news School is not yet out, but the UK’s transport network appears to be readying itself for summer disruption. In other business news today: In the UK, Downing Street plays down reports of UK-US split over Ukraine Nato membership after Sunak-Biden meeting In our coverage of the BBC crisis: minister tells broadcaster to get ‘house in order’ over suspended presenter In the US, campaigners to call for formal investigations into alleged supreme court corruption In our coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war: Nato chief ‘absolutely certain’ summit will have ‘unity and a strong message’ on Ukraine membership Thank you for following our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Please do join us bright and early tomorrow for more of the same. JJ Transport for London (TfL) has been locked in a long-running dispute with unions over plans to reduce staff numbers to save costs. A new attendance procedure which would “mean no right to representation or appeal at stage one of the disciplinary process and the length of all warnings would be doubled from 26 to 52 weeks.” The ability of TfL to redeploy drivers if they are sick for longer than one week. A programme of “trains modernisation”, which the union said could drive shifts up to 10 hours long. The replacement of all existing agreements, “allowing them to cut hundreds more jobs and forcing those of us who remain to work harder for longer”. London Underground train drivers who are members of Aslef will strike on Wednesday 26 and Friday 28 July, the train drivers’ union has announced. Aslef drivers will join counterparts represented by the RMT, who were already planning action at the same time. Aslef members on the tube – including management grades, London Underground offices, and London Underground test trains - will not book on for any duty between 00.01 and 23.59 on Wednesday 26 and any duty between 00.01 and 23.59 Friday 28 July. The Unite union, one of the biggest in the UK, has voted to remain affiliated with the Labour party, but warned that it will not be given a “blank cheque” if it comes to power. A move to disaffiliate would have represented a major change in the relations between small “l” labour and the state, but Unite’s leadership argued that it was better to retain influence – by continuing to fund the Labour party – with all indications from polling suggesting that Keir Starmer will be the next prime minister. Unite counts workers from across the economy as its workers, ranging from bus drivers, to factory workers and cleaners. The Guardian’s senior political correspondent, Aubrey Allegretti, reports: Delegates “overwhelmingly” chose to retain Unite’s formal link with Labour, with Graham among those who spoke in favour. “This is the moment of maximum leverage for the union where we can hold Labour to account,” she said. “Now cannot be the time to walk away. We would be weakening our own arm. “It would be the worst time to leave the Labour party when they are in touching distance of power. If we leave we wouldn’t influence that power.” You can read the full report here: Oil prices have dropped by 1% on Monday as traders react to the prospect of a slowing Chinese economy. The price of a barrel of Brent crude (the North Sea benchmark) for September delivery dropped to $77.73 on Monday, while the West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit $73.14. Deflation in China could herald less economic activity across the world, leading to lower demand for fuel. However, prices have been held up by Opec (the Organisation of Petroleum-Exporting Countries, a global cartel). Reuters explains: “The presence of economic slowdowns in China adds to the prevailing uncertainty in the oil market,” said Mukesh Sahdev, head of downstream and oil trading at Rystad Energy. “The market’s instability is further fueled by the ongoing tug-of-war between fears of demand control by Western economies and the supply-control strategies employed by OPEC, which impacts the oil market’s delicate balance.” The pound is down by 0.4% against the US dollar on Monday, but it remains close to a 15-month high at $1.2785. However, any talk of relative strength has to be put in context: the last 10 years have not been kind to people holding sterling. From above $1.70 in 2014 one pound is now only worth $1.27. Back on the mortgage front, the Financial Times reports an increase in remortgaging as homeowners try to lock in rates that a few years ago would have looked impossibly high. The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 6.63%, as Moneyfacts reported. The Bank of England’s base rate is 5%. But if the base rate rises to 6.5% – a situation that financial market bets suggest is almost a 50/50 probability by March – then mortgage rates could well be above 8%. It is an unenviable situation for people whose fixed-rate terms run out in the next year: lock in rates that may seem unaffordable now, or risk them rising much higher later. Meanwhile, customers’ remortgage requests at Moneybox Homebuying, an online mortgage service provider, rose to represent 17 per cent of its mortgage-related applications in June, above a monthly average of 11 per cent. The interest rate pain will not be felt immediately across the population because so many homeowners are on fixed rates. That is good and bad news for the government: good, because it spreads the hit to the economy over a longer period (by which time growth may have picked up); bad, because it means that interest rate increases may take longer to feed through to lower inflation. The UK might be grappling with inflation well above target, but financial traders have today been eyeing Chinese price data which suggests the world’s second-largest economy is facing the opposite problem: deflation. China’s consumer price index was unchanged year-on-year for June, after rising by 0.2% in May. Economists had expected a 0.2% rise. Producer prices (which measures what things cost when they leave the factory) also fell sharply. Reuters said: Momentum in China’s post-pandemic recovery has slowed from a brisk pickup seen in the first quarter with demand for industrial and consumer products weakening, raising concerns about the health of the world’s second-largest economy. The Financial Times reported: “China is still growing — the question is whether it will hit its target,” said Heron Lim, economist at Moody’s Analytics. “In terms of that recovery, it is still there, but the concern is it’s slowing down.” We focused on the mortgage rates data earlier from Moneyfacts, but there is also an interesting point in their update on rates offered to savers: they are rising, but not nearly as fast. While mortgage rates charged to borrowers rose by 0.09 percentage points, savings rates paid to savers (who are lending their cash to the bank), rose by much less. This shows why banks (for the most part) like higher interest rates: they can expand the difference between the price they charge borrowers, and the price they pay lenders – called net interest margin. Flight cancellations are a summer perennial, but it is always good to remember that travellers have fairly strong rights if they are left in the lurch. Here are some things to remember (from a handy guide from this time last year): Here is that handy guide: EasyJet has cancelled 1,700 flights over July, August and September mostly at Gatwick as London’s second-largest airport struggles to cope with the first fully post-pandemic year. The cancellations will affect 180,000 passengers, although the airline said that 95% of those affected had already been booked onto alternative flights. The rest have been offered a refund. The airline blamed air traffic control delays that have been worsened by the war in Ukraine, rather than pilot or crew shortages. The majority of the cancellations are at Gatwick because of easyJet’s major presence there, but it is also understood that air traffic control delays at Gatwick are around three times longer before the pandemic. An easyJet spokeswoman said: Customers whose flights are affected are being informed, with 95% customers being rebooked onto an alternative flight and all customers provided with the option to rebook or receive a refund. We are sorry for any inconvenience that this may have caused. Here is some interesting mortgage data this morning from Moneyfacts: average two-year fixed mortgage rates have risen to almost the same level as they were when Liz Truss’s premiership collapsed in chaos. Reuters reports: Mortgage rates surged in October as financial markets reacted to a big fiscal expansion planned by Truss and her even-briefer-in-post chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng. The thinking was that the Bank of England would be forced to raise interest rates sharply to tame expected inflation. Truss and Kwarteng were forced out before that could happen, to be replaced by Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt. But it appears the respite was only brief: stubborn inflation has prompted the Bank of England to raise rates anyway. That is a huge problem for the Conservative party, which (probably) can’t pull the same trick twice of switching the leadership team to get rates back down. The share price movement after a chief executive resignation announcement is about as close you can get to a market valuation for a person. So what has happened at BT after news of Philip Jansen’s departure in the coming year? Shares in BT have dropped by 1.1% in early trading on Monday morning. That is a drop of about £130m. Then again, Jansen’s departure had already been floated earlier this year, so perhaps we shouldn’t read into it too closely. Of more import for shareholders is BT’s performance during Jansen’s time as leader. The company has struggled, and shares have almost halved. A quick check in on stock markets after they opened for the week shows us… not much. Thames Water’s shares are not listed, but there has been some buying of its bonds, Reuters reported: Thames Water’s interim co-chief executive, Cathryn Ross, has rejected criticisms that regulators and the water industry are too cosy. “I don’t accept that,” she said. Ross highlighted her three and a half years at BT between working at Ofwat and Thames Water. Ross said she is “deeply passionate about the water industry”, but added that all senior public officials who join the industry within a few years must seek assent from Acoba, or the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. The committee can object or ask for conditions on employment by former public servants, although it has long been criticised as a toothless regulator. Ross said: However, Ross said she did not agree with that finding: We have to accept those findings, we have to learn the lessons and move on, and that’s what we’re doing. Thames Water’s boss has defended the company against accusations that shareholders are benefiting from interest payments on its big debt pile, saying the company has the “lowest level of indebtedness in a decade”. Thames Water paid £45m to service the debt held by shareholders in the last year, Cathryn Ross said, comparing it to revenues of £2.3bn. She said: “It is an option the government has, but it’s a very high bar and we are not close to it,” said Thames Water boss Ross. Thames Water interim co-chief executive Cathryn Ross has said the company is not close to needing temporary nationalisation. Speaking on BBC radio’s Today programme to explain the new injection of £750m in equity funding, Ross said the company now has enough money to pay its debts for the next year and into the future. Asked whether Thames was in a financial hole, Ross said: “Not at all.” The company’s £4.4bn in cash and credit facilities would tide the company over, she said: Special administration – in which the government would take temporary control of the company in order to make sure homes and businesses still received their water – would be the “nuclear option”, with a “very high bar”. The company is “absolutely not” close to that bar, Ross said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The new money will be delivered by Thames Water until March 2025, the company said in a statement to investors. It adds to £500m in funding received last year. The company has been caught out by rising interest rates, which have threatened its ability to pay interest on its £16bn debt pile. Jansen will step down “at an appropriate moment over the next 12 months he intends to step down from his role”, BT said in a stock market announcement on Monday. The succession process to replace Philip is something that the board was well prepared for. All appropriate candidates are being considered and we expect to be able to update the market on progress over the course of the summer. In the meantime, it is business as usual, and we are focused on executing our plans and delivering for all our stakeholders. Jansen’s successor will have the task of carrying out a major job cuts programme as the company seeks to be more efficient – once it has completed the rollout of 5G mobile infrastructure. Jansen said: This is creating a much stronger BT Group which is starting to drive growth for both investors and the UK. But there’s a lot more to do and I am fully committed to driving the business forward until I hand over to my successor. The great and the good of the City will gather at Mansion House in London tonight, to hear from the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. Hunt is expected to tell an audience of City leaders and chief executives that the government has reached a so-called “compact” deal with some of the UK’s largest investment firms that could see about 5% of pension fund investments reserved for early-stage businesses in sectors including life sciences and fintech. In his first Mansion House speech, Hunt is likely to say: 2pm BST: Bank of Israel’s interest rate decision 4pm BST: Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey’s Mansion House speech to be pre-released Evening: Mansion House event

Andrea Leadsom held shares in Barclays when questioning bank’s ex-boss Exclusive: Revelation about Tory former minister raises questions about adequacy of transparency rules The rules at the time required MPs to register any shareholdings worth more than their parliamentary salary. The threshold for disclosure today is £70,000. Leadsom’s shares may have been below the threshold, but the rules also required members to disclose shareholdings that might be thought to influence their actions in parliament. These rules included proceedings in select committees and required MPs to declare their interests at the beginning of their remarks. Leadsom made no disclosure as she questioned Diamond, who resigned as chief executive the day before he gave evidence. Her ownership of undeclared shares could be seen as a conflict of interest and the revelation raises questions about the adequacy of parliament’s transparency rules. However, MPs need only register holdings they have in a company, including if it is jointly owned, when their share is more than 15% or when the holding is worth more than £70,000 as of the beginning of April.  If a shareholding is below the threshold but might “reasonably be thought by others to influence a member’s actions”, it must be registered.  There is no requirement to register dividend income. Separately MPs must declare interests that could reasonably be thought to influence their parliamentary actions such as speaking in a debate. In these instances they are expected to declare indirect financial interests including those of a family member. A spokesperson for Leadsom said: “Dame Andrea Leadsom’s declarations have been transparent and accurate in accordance with the rules and the law at all times.” The register does not detail the number of shares Leadsom had in the bank at the time of her questioning of Diamond. It shows she first became a shareholder in Barclays in 2002 and that her direct ownership of the shares ended in May 2014, a month after she was appointed economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister. A summary of her taxes released during the 2016 Conservative leadership contest, from which she withdrew while up against Theresa May, revealed that in 2015-16 she received £2,324 in dividends and had capital gains of £9,270, suggesting she still benefitted from shares beyond 2014.

Attorney general and close family hold £130,000 in shares in six FTSE 100 firms Exclusive: Victoria Prentis’s shareholdings not disclosed in registers despite potential for conflicts of interest However, MPs need only register holdings they have in a company, including if it is jointly owned, when their share is more than 15% or when the holding is worth more than £70,000 as of the beginning of April.  If a shareholding is below the threshold but might “reasonably be thought by others to influence a member’s actions”, it must be registered.  There is no requirement to register dividend income. Separately MPs must declare interests that could reasonably be thought to influence their parliamentary actions such as speaking in a debate. In these instances they are expected to declare indirect financial interests including those of a family member. The Tesco shares were held while she was in a previous ministerial job in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), where she met lobbyists for the supermarket chain six times. The Tesco shareholding was not publicly disclosed in the list of ministers’ interests. Her spokesperson declined to comment on any of her or her family’s shareholdings, which were identified in company shareholder registers. The registers, which are only accessible by members of the public in specific circumstances, were secured by the Guardian after formal legal requests. A barrister who worked as a government lawyer before being elected MP for Banbury in 2015, Prentis was appointed as attorney general by Rishi Sunak in October 2022. Her father, Tim Boswell, was an MP until 2010. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve told the Guardian the role’s functions required a “superabundance of caution” towards potential conflicts of interest. The attorney general has powers on judicial proceedings such as prosecutions and appeals on sentencing. Grieve said he had moved all of his and his wife’s investments into a blind trust upon his appointment as attorney general in 2010. This involves moving investments into a trust managed by an independent third party, removing the ability to affect individual investments. The trustees can be given general directions about the nature of the investments by the beneficiary, but they do not give specific information on the shares in the trust. But this did not completely resolve the potential for conflicts of interest, Grieve said. “There was still an issue – I knew what I had at the time I became a minister,” he said. “And if for any reason an issue might have arisen when I was attorney general that might have related to issues to shareholdings I knew I had, there might have been a conflict of interest, in which case I’d have flagged it up with my private office and the solicitor general would have dealt with the matter. That didn’t arise but that’s the sort of issue you need to think about.” Prentis’s most recent entry in the list of ministers’ interests is sparse. It states she is a trustee of a family trust but provides no further information on the holdings or beneficiaries of the trust. While she was a Defra minister, the list of ministers’ interests in May 2022 did note that Prentis held shares in the consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser, raising a question about why other shareholdings were not declared.

Revealed: shares held ‘in secret’ by scores of MPs raise questions about vested interests Exclusive: MPs found to hold ‘in effect secret’ stock in listed firms from banks to housebuilders More than 50 MPs have owned stakes in publicly listed companies that raise questions about possible conflicts of interest and that until now have been in effect secret, the Guardian can reveal. Parliamentary rules mean MPs’ shareholdings, including ones that were held by the former prime minister Theresa May and the former education secretary Gavin Williamson, do not need to be publicly disclosed in parliamentary registers. But as a result voters are left in the dark about some of the financial interests of their elected representatives. Almost all of the holdings found are not strictly required to be publicly declared under current transparency requirements. Parliamentary rules, unchanged since 2015, require MPs to register holdings they have in a single company when they own more than 15% of its shares or when their shares in it are worth more than £70,000. Steve Goodrich, the head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK, said: “If an MP has shares in a company affected by legislation going through parliament, there’s invariably a tension between them protecting their financial affairs and advancing the public good. Having these details out in the open is a key safeguard against abuse of public office. “The public have the right to know what role money plays in our politics. Cumulatively, financial interests undoubtedly influence – whether consciously or otherwise – the outlook of MPs and ministers, and how they set about tackling the big issues of our time. Understanding who has skin in what game is essential to unpicking policy inertia, be it on housing, climate change or the cost of living.” The list of MPs with shareholdings includes the chair of the environment select committee, Robert Goodwill; the Conservative backbencher Desmond Swayne; the shadow business minister Seema Malhotra, and the SNP chief whip, Brendan O’Hara. All these holdings are below the threshold. The investigation has also established that the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, had a financial stake in National Grid until two days before he was selected as the Conservative candidate for his constituency. The prime minister said he had put his current investments into a blind trust, a mechanism used by MPs to distance themselves from their financial interests, in July 2019. May owned shares in BP while she was the home secretary, while at the same time her husband held shares in BP, Barclays, BT and Centrica. Four months after she became the prime minister these shares also seem to have been moved into a blind trust. The majority of the shareholdings found by the Guardian fall under the £70,000 threshold but the investigation has uncovered apparent conflicts of interest, including May holding meetings with BT as home secretary while her husband, Philip May, held shares in the company, which had not been publicly disclosed. A spokesperson said: “Theresa May entirely rejects any suggestion that she breached parliamentary rules or the ministerial code in relation to a financial interest in BT held by her husband.” They added that May had introduced legislation that was not in BT’s interest and that she had always declared all financial interests to the relevant civil service officials. However, MPs need only register holdings they have in a company, including if it is jointly owned, when their share is more than 15% or when the holding is worth more than £70,000 as of the beginning of April.  If a shareholding is below the threshold but might “reasonably be thought by others to influence a member’s actions”, it must be registered.  There is no requirement to register dividend income. Separately MPs must declare interests that could reasonably be thought to influence their parliamentary actions such as speaking in a debate. In these instances they are expected to declare indirect financial interests including those of a family member. The investigation has identified ministers who have met lobbyists for companies, including BP, while not declaring the shares held by themselves or their close family members. MPs have also voted against amendments that would have increased windfall taxes on oil and gas companies in which they had undisclosed shares. The shareholdings identified are all within companies that would have been affected by recent government policy or where there has been parliamentary debate that could result in actions that would have an impact on a company’s bottom line, such as a potential energy windfall tax. The shareholdings identified by the Guardian have only come to light following a six-month investigation that involved working with lawyers to gain access to shareholder registers, and then with software engineers to analyse the tens of thousands of pages of entries. Shareholder registers used to be available upon request to the public. In 2006, however, changes were made to the Companies Act that made it significantly more difficult to get the registers, after concerns were raised about how they were being used to target directors and shareholders in companies perceived to be connected to animal rights violations. The registers can still be accessed if a member of the public or a journalist puts in a formal request that satisfies stringent tests to ensure the registers will be used for a “proper purpose”. Dr Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “It is very concerning that it should be so hard to uncover who owns shares in publicly listed companies in this country, rendering them in effect secret.” Goodrich at Transparency International UK suggested the share registers should return to being easily accessible by the public. “That it’s been such a slog to access basic information on plc shareholders highlights the opacity of corporate law for listed companies,” he said. “These findings show why investor information should be more accessible.” The Guardian analysed the registers of members, which provide a full list of shareholders, of 29 companies in the FTSE 100. Three companies from the FTSE 250 were also analysed. These included the registers for high street banks that have found themselves under pressure following steep increases in mortgage rates; supermarkets that have lobbied against a potential crackdown on processed food, and energy companies that have publicly argued against increasing a windfall tax while announcing record profits. None of these shareholdings identified were individually above the £70,000 threshold that requires an MP to publicly declare their stake, but questions arise as to whether they may still be considered relevant for disclosure under the rule that suggests members should register any interest that might be reasonably thought to influence their actions in parliament. Without similar rules being introduced in the UK, an MP could trade £69,999.99 in shares in a single company and not strictly be required to disclose the financial dealing. They could hold stakes of this level in several companies operating in the same sector and still not be required to declare the holdings. Civil servants are required to declare to their department any shares held by themselves, their spouse or partner, their parents, siblings or children “which they would be able to further as a result of their official position”. There is no threshold set for these declarations. There is also no requirement for MPs to declare any income from dividends nor any income gained from the sale of shares. This contrasts to the rules around income from employment where anything more than £300 a year must be disclosed. Ten years ago the standards committee rejected calls by the European anti-corruption body Greco to lower the threshold for registering shareholdings. The committee said that “leaving aside questions of privacy, we believe too low a threshold could obscure significant matters in a blizzard of trivial details”. The report was passed unanimously by the committee’s members, including Christopher Chope. The investigation reveals that Chope, first elected in 1983, seems to have had a personal interest in keeping the threshold high. Chope did not respond to requests for comment.

Wife of Tory MP who criticised windfall tax on oil firms has £50,000 in BP shares David Duguid opposing tax while wife is in receipt of BP dividends raises questions over potential conflict of interest An analysis of BP’s shareholder register by the Guardian suggests Duguid moved his shares into his wife’s name five years before his election as an MP. Today, she has more than 11,000 shares and will have received more than £2,000 last year in dividends. The rules require MPs to declare the financial interests of a spouse or other family member, where there could be considered a conflict. Duguid has never publicly disclosed his wife’s financial interest in the House of Commons register. However, MPs need only register holdings they have in a company, including if it is jointly owned, when their share is more than 15% or when the holding is worth more than £70,000 as of the beginning of April.  If a shareholding is below the threshold but might “reasonably be thought by others to influence a member’s actions”, it must be registered.  There is no requirement to register dividend income. Separately MPs must declare interests that could reasonably be thought to influence their parliamentary actions such as speaking in a debate. In these instances they are expected to declare indirect financial interests including those of a family member. Since the beginning of 2022, Duguid, Conservative MP for Banff and Buchan, has declared interests in BP in two debates, but only by reference to his prior employment for 25 years in the oil and gas industry, including 10 years with BP. The Guardian’s investigation also raises questions about the processes for ministerial declarations, which similarly require the declaration of interests of close family members. Despite Duguid’s involvement with energy policy in the Scotland Office, his wife’s shares were not published in the list of ministers’ interests published by the Cabinet Office. He was a junior minister in the department from June 2020 until September 2021 under Boris Johnson, and again in Liz Truss’s brief administration in October 2022. The ministerial code requires newly appointed ministers to provide their department’s permanent secretary with a list of all the interests held by themselves, their spouses and close family members that could give rise to a conflict. This includes shareholdings under the parliamentary threshold of £70,000. It is then the decision of the independent adviser on ministers’ interests which “relevant” interests are published. Ministers, the document says, “must scrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or perceived conflict of interest between their ministerial position and their private financial interests”. As well as meeting with oil and gas lobbyists, Duguid worked on the North Sea transition deal, announced in March 2021. This was an agreement between the UK government and the oil and gas industry to work together on meeting net zero commitments by 2050, with the government pledging to support bringing billions of pounds of investment into the industry. BP’s shareholder register shows Duguid stopped being a shareholder in BP in November 2012, on the same day his wife joined the company’s register of members. He was first elected in 2017. Duguid is also vice-chair of the British offshore oil and gas industry all-party parliamentary group, which is supported by OEUK. He recently suggested in parliament that plans proposed by Labour to ban new oil and gas drilling were “based on ideology”.

Which UK MPs own shares in publicly listed companies? List of 41 MPs who currently benefit from shareholdings in companies from banks to housebuilders and supermarkets The Guardian is publishing a list of 41 MPs who own, or have an interest in, shares in 17 publicly listed companies. Parliamentary transparency rules require the disclosure of a shareholding in any single company worth more than £70,000. The majority of the shares identified are below this threshold. Nonetheless the Guardian is publishing the full list of MPs and their shareholdings so the public has a greater view of the financial interests of their elected representatives. In some cases, the MP’s interest is an indirect one as the shares are held by members of their close family. Where this is the case it is noted below. This published list does not include shareholdings that MPs have disposed of. However, MPs need only register holdings they have in a company, including if it is jointly owned, when their share is more than 15% or when the holding is worth more than £70,000 as of the beginning of April.  If a shareholding is below the threshold but might “reasonably be thought by others to influence a member’s actions”, it must be registered.  There is no requirement to register dividend income. Separately MPs must declare interests that could reasonably be thought to influence their parliamentary actions such as speaking in a debate. In these instances they are expected to declare indirect financial interests including those of a family member. All share valuations have been taken from the close of the markets on 30 June. Shareholding data is from registers received between February and May.

US wage growth stronger than expected in June, but job creation slows – as it happened Average pay rose in June, in a boost to US employees – but a potential headache for the Federal Reserve. In June, average hourly earnings rose by 12 cents, or 0.4%, to $33.58, ahead of expectations of a 0.3% rise. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.4%, ahead of expectations of a 4.2% annual rise. Time for a recap In a statement, Biden declared: The US dollar has lost ground, and is now down 0.7% against a basket of currencies today, and at a two-week low against the yen. Bond and equity markets are calm, after a volatile selloff on Thursday, with economists predicting US interest rates will be raised again later this month. “Average hourly earnings were also up more than expected, rising 0.4% on the month and showing a 4.4% advance year-on-year. The broader unemployment rate fell to 3.6%. The US economy looks far from softening. All these factors mean interest rate hikes are back on the agenda. We expect the Fed to raise rates at its meeting later this month.” Travellers catching ferries from Dover faced queues of up to two hours on Friday as traffic built up at border posts. The Kent port said passengers should expect waits of up to two hours for coaches and 90 minutes for cars, as traffic built up in the morning. Ferries were operating normally, and passengers are allowed to catch subsequent sailings. A combination of the sun, the start of school holidays in parts of the UK, and a school teachers’ strike offering parents a potential long weekend may have contributed to the pressure on the port. UK house prices experienced their biggest annual fall in 12 years, according to Halifax. Prices fell by 2.6% year-on-year, in the latest sign that soaring interest rates on mortgages is bringing a halt to the housing boom. Half of older adults who left the UK workforce amid mass redundancies in the first year of the Covid pandemic ended up falling into relative poverty, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). South East Water, which left thousands of households without running water last month spent more on dividends and servicing its debt pile over two years than investing in infrastructure, it has emerged. Here’s Erik Norland, Senior Economist at CME Group, on the jobs report: Thursday’s JOLTS survey showed that there were 9.8 million job openings at the end of May, about three million than there were in late 2019 before the pandemic. This implies the possibility of strong demand for workers in the months ahead, even if economic activity slows in response to the Fed’s rate hikes.” The US president has hailed June’s jobs report as evidence that “Bidenomics” is working, delivering sustainable economic growth. That’s more jobs added in two and a half years than any president has ever created in a four-year term. The unemployment rate has now remained below 4% for 17 months in a row—the longest stretch since the 1960s. The share of working-age Americans who have jobs is at the highest level in over 20 years. Inflation has come down by more than half. We are seeing stable and steady growth. That’s Bidenomics—growing the economy by creating jobs, lowering costs for hardworking families, and making smart investments in America. This chart shows pretty clearly that US job creation is in a downward trend, once you account for the downward revisions to the April and May jobs reports: The White House Council of Economic Advisers have tweeted their views on today’s US jobs report – which they argue shows more jobs created than you’d normally expect. Monthly nominal average hourly earnings growth held steady at 0.4 percent in June. We do not have the inflation report for June yet, which will include real wage growth. 8/ The stronger-than-expected wage growth in June suggests that US firms were prepared to sign off pay rises for workers, or paying more for new staff. Notably, Average Hourly Earnings rose more than expected in June, another signal that demand for labor remains robust. In our view, there is nothing in the data that would cause the Federal Reserve (Fed) to hit the brakes on a rate hike in July. The labor market continues to show sufficient strength that we expect the Fed to follow through with another 25 basis point rate hike in July, and make few changes to its previous statements regarding the strength of the labor market. Looking forward to the likelihood of a September rate hike, we think that decision will largely be driven by data releases between now and then.” Futures trading indicates there is a 90% chance that the Federal Reserve lifts rates at its meeting later this month, having paused in June. Wall Street has opened in the red. This suggests investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates higher, given the resilience in the US joba markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 large US companies, fell 85.19 points, or 0.25%, at the open to 33,837.07. The broader S&P 500 opened 7.05 points lower, or -0.16%, at 4,404.54, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite lost 10.98 points, or almost 0.1%, to 13,668.07 at the opening bell. US short-term government bonds have recovered some of their earlier losses, after the jobs report was released. This has pulled the yield, or interest rate, on 2-year Treasury Bills down to 4.98%. That’s back below the 5% mark hit yesterday for the first time since March, as yields hit 15-year highs. Yields rise when bond prices fall, and the recent surge in yields follows increases in US interest rates and expectations of further rises to fight inflation. There was also a rise in Americans being moved onto part-time work due to weakening demand in June, the jobs report shows. The number of people employed part-time for economic reasons increased by 452,000 to 4.2 million in June. This "partially” reflects an increase in the number of people whose hours were cut due to slack work or business conditions, the report says, even though they would have preferred full-time employment. In summary, 209,000 additional jobs is still strong, unemployment is historically low and average hourly earnings rose. It was interesting to see, given weakness in the sector, that manufacturing employment actually rose. Bottom line, despite the noticeably softer number versus yesterday, which is catalysing a rebound in risk sentiment, this doesn’t detract from the narrative that the Fed has more work to do on rates.’ “Now attention will turn to next week’s CPI report. Without a slowdown in monthly core inflation, market focus may start turning to whether rate hikes will persist into September and, from there, questioning how much more monetary tightening the U.S. economy can realistically take before something breaks.” With the unemployment rate remaining at just 3.6%, employees are in short supply resulting in workers’ hourly wages now rising faster than headline inflation. With numbers like these, a recession looks improbable any time soon.” The rise was lower than the 240,000 jobs economists had expected and lower than the 309,000 jobs added in May. But the gain was the 30th consecutive month of jobs gains and the unemployment rate ticked down to the historically low rate of 3.6%. The US job market has remained robust despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive attempts to slow the economy and tamp down inflation with more than a year of interest rate hikes. Disappointingly, US job growth in April was weaker than previously thought. Today’s payroll report shows that April’s data has been revised down by 77,000, from +294,000 to +217,000. Include May’s downward revision of 33k, and this means 110,000 fewer jobs were created in these two months than first reported. These revisions aren’t unusual – NFP reports are typically adjusted after their first release. But it does raise questions over whether the strength of the labor market has been overstated.. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is down 0.3% today, while the pound is up half a cent against the greenback at $1.2788. Average pay rose in June, in a boost to US employees – but a potential headache for the Federal Reserve. In June, average hourly earnings rose by 12 cents, or 0.4%, to $33.58, ahead of expectations of a 0.3% rise. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.4%, ahead of expectations of a 4.2% annual rise.

FTSE 100 falls to lowest closing level in 2023 as interest rate fears grip markets Markets suffer on both sides of Atlantic as Fed signals more rate hikes and recession fears grow in UK Global financial markets fell sharply on Thursday as investors braced for central banks driving interest rates up further to combat high inflation across the world’s leading economies. Share prices fell on both sides of the Atlantic with the FTSE 100 tumbling by 161 points, or 2.2%, to finish the day at 7,280 – its lowest level since last November – while stocks fell by a similar amount across Europe and by more than 1% in New York. The yield, or interest rate, on two-year UK government bonds rose by more than 0.1 of a percentage point to about 5.5%, the highest level since 2007. Reflecting the prospect of higher central bank interest rates, US government bond yields rose by a similar amount to just over 5%, while borrowing costs also rose across the EU. Mining giant Glencore was the top faller on the FTSE 100, with a drop of 5.5%, followed by retail chain Next, copper producer Antofagasta and gambling group Flutter, on a day when just three companies gained in value – Severn Trent, Tesco, and United Utilities. Figures published on Thursday showed continued strength in the US jobs market in June, which economists said could add to inflationary pressures in the world’s largest economy. “If a rate hike this month wasn’t already nailed on, it probably is now,” said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at the financial trading firm Oanda. “I’m sure everyone will be revising up their expectations on the back of it and wondering just how much longer this labour market resilience can last. How high must rates go?” Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Andy Haldane, the Bank’s former chief economist, called on the central bank to hold back from raising rates further, suggesting there were growing risks of “overreaction and overcorrection”. “Rising rate expectations hit FTSE 100,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online trading platform IG. “Commodity prices are down as the dollar strengthens, but it is the wave of expectations that UK interest rates will go even higher than previously thought that has really done the damage. “While the calls for rates to hit 7% seem a little overeager, they do have further to go.”

FTSE 100 hits lowest closing level of 2023 as interest rate rise fears grip markets – business live FTSE 100 index posts biggest one-day fall since March, as strong US jobs report fuels fears of even higher US interest rates Time for a recap: Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, says: London’s FTSE 100 saw just three stocks end the day in positive territory, with United Utilities and Severn Trent making up a touch of the ground lost since fears were raised about the financial health of Thames Water and supermarket giant Tesco proving that every little does indeed help. It was with a sense of déjà vu investors ruminated over impending recession warning signs and a Fed back in hawkish form. This labor market strength is likely to prompt America’s central bank to raise interest rates again soon, perhaps later this month. The City are now fully pricing-in that UK interest rates will soar to 6.5% by December, up from 5% at present. And the interest rates on UK two-year government bonds has hit a 15-year high today, as gilts continued to be sold off by anxious traders. Here are the rest of today’s main stories so far: Britain’s financial watchdog has concluded its meeting with the UK’s top banks today, to discuss why savings rates are so low despite the rise in interest rates. Here’s the statement: Through preparation for our new consumer duty, which requires the firms we regulate to put consumer interests at their heart, we have started to see some positive action by banks and building societies to improve their rates, and to ensure their customers are benefiting from better value products. We now want to see that progress accelerate. We are also increasingly seeing customers switching their savings products to those with higher rates. We continue to urge savers to shop around to make sure they’re getting the best deal. We want to see a competitive market with fair value retail banking products – and with banks helping consumers to access them. We discussed how our consumer duty will set a new standard for firms from the end of July, including on savings rates. We set out that expectation to bank and building society leaders in today’s meeting. Those in the room recognised that they needed to do more to help their consumers access the best rates. We too recognise there is a need for further guidance, and will continue our focus on this. We have previously committed to reporting at the end of the month on how the savings market is supporting savers to benefit from higher interest rates. We will set out then whether further steps are needed. There are heavy losses across European markets. The oil price has also weakened today, on fears that higher interest rates will hit demand for energy. Brent crude is down 1.5% at $75.4 per barrel. Newsflash: The UK’s FTSE 100 share index has posted its biggest one-day loss since the banking panic of March. The index of blue-chip shares has closed down 161 points, or 2.17%, at 7,280 points, as anxiety over future interest rate rises grip the markets. That’s the biggest fall since 15 March, and takes the index down to its lowest closing level since early November 2022. Lavazza has warned over a double-digit drop in earnings this year amid surging coffee bean costs and said its prices are not set to come down for consumers until 2024. The Italian coffee giant said it is braced for a hefty drop in underlying earnings over 2023 as it looks to limit price hikes. It raised its prices by 6.2% in 2022, but saw its costs jump to 550 million euros – almost double its underlying earnings last year. Giuseppe Lavazza, chairman of Lavazza, told PA Media that it has not risen prices further in 2023, but that this is impacting its profits as it faces “unprecedented” increases in coffee bean prices. The selloff is continuing to gather pace in London too. With around half an hour’s trading to go, the FTSE 100 is now down 166 points or 2.25% at 7,27 points, on track for its weakest closing level this year. Here’s Michael Hewson of CMC Markets on today’s market selloff: The clear willingness amongst many FOMC members to do much more on rates, and the clear hawkish guidance spooked markets and along with today’s bumper ADP payrolls report, cemented the idea that Fed officials are very serious about meeting their inflation target and the resilience of the labour market will only likely reinforce this view, as it will give the FOMC more latitude to be more aggressive when it comes to rates. This has also seen the DAX and CAC 40 slide back sharply, with the DAX falling to 3-month lows, while the CAC40 has undergone its worst day since the March sell-off. Not only are we seeing US rates head higher, but UK rates are surging as well, and not just on the short end. While the 2-year gilt is now above 5.5%, and a new 15 year high, the 10-year gilt yield is back at the highs seen last October above 4.6%, as traders revise up their estimates of when the Bank of England is likely to stop hiking rates, with the latest being at 6.5% early next year. This apparent willingness by central banks to crush demand, and risk pushing the economy into a recession to get inflation under control, is prompting investors to pare down their exposure to equity markets, hence today’s sell-off. Microsoft are the only riser on the Dow (out of 30 companies) Bitcoin has now fallen back from this morning’s 13-month high…. More Americans quit their jobs last month, the latest JOLTS report shows: Total job openings fell, but remained high, at 9.824 million in May, down from 10.103 million in April. A quick recap on the situation, in a bad day for the markets. The Footsie has now sunk below the 7,300 mark for the first time since March, and is down 145 points or 2% at 7,296 points. Nearly every stock has lost ground, with house-builders and mining companies among the fallers. Reuters is reporting that MSCI’S benchmark ACWI index of world shares is down 1.5% and on course for biggest daily fall of the year. Shares are being hit by renewed fears that central banks will continue to raise interest rates as they battle inflation. This is causing a sharp selloff in the bond markets, and in shares. Both the US and UK short-term government bonds have hit their highest levels in 15 years. UK two-year bond yields have hit 5.51%, while US two-year Treasury bills are now yielding 5.06% – both the highest levels since 2008. The money markets are now indicating there is a greater-than-evens chance that UK interest rates have risen to 6.5% before Christmas, up from 5% today. That would be the highest level in 25 years…. UK INTEREST RATE SWAPS SHOW 53% CHANCE OF BOE RATES REACHING 6.5% BY DEC 2023, GREATER THAN 80% CHANCE BY MARCH 2024 Wall Street’s “fear index”, the CBOE volatility index, has hit its highest level in over a month. CBOE VOLATILITY INDEX HITS OVER ONE-MONTH HIGH; LAST UP 1.45 POINTS AT 15.60 Correction to previous post: German two-year bonds are trading at a yield of 3.3%, much lower than the UK’s 5.5%. German 10-year bunds are trading at a 2.6% yield, compared to the UK’s 4.6% or 4% for US 10-year Treasuries. UK government bonds continue to be pummelled. The yield, or interest rate, on two-year UK gilts has risen to 5.51%, a new 15-year high, up from 5.36% last night. That’s higher than comparible countries – US two-year Treasury bills trade at a yield of 5%, while Germany can borrow for two years at 3.3% (corrected). Federal Reserve policymakers may well be dreading tomorrow’s jobs report now after today’s ADP number has coming in more than double the consensus forecast, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. Erlam explains: If a rate hike this month wasn’t already nailed on, it probably is now. The ADP isn’t often a great precursor to the NFP number but this is a report you simply can’t ignore. I’m sure everyone will be revising up their expectations on the back of it and wondering just how much longer this labour market resilience can last. How high must rates go? Stocks have also opened sharply lower in New York, as investors fret that further interest rate increases are on the horizon. As we covered earlier, that’s more than double expectations, implying that further monetary policy tightening will be rolled out to cool the US economy. Private payrolls rose by 497,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment report showed on Thursday, up from a downwardly revised level of 267,000 in May. Economists had expected the reading to tick up by 228,000. The minutes of the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting, released last night, indicated that officials intend to resume interest rate increases at future meetings to fight inflation, after pausing in June.

Rail firms unveil plans for mass closure of England’s ticket offices to ‘modernise’ railway – as it happened Plans will ramp up battle with unions; boss of water watchdog says higher water bills are coming to fund infrastructure improvements Rail firms have announced plans for the mass closure of England’s ticket offices to “modernise” the railway, ramping up the battle with unions and infuriating disability and passenger groups. The move, pushed by the government to save costs, was confirmed by the industry body, the Rail Delivery Group. Train operators told staff on Wednesday morning of proposals to shut down almost all of the 1,007 remaining offices, bar at the busiest stations, within three years. The RDG said ticket office staff would move on to station platforms and concourses in “new and engaging roles”. However, many fear job losses, with any guarantees offered over compulsory redundancies in pay talks set to expire at the end of next year. However, the industry argues that only 12% of tickets are now bought at offices, down from 82% in 1995, with moves continuing to expand contactless payments and online purchasing.

We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care – JK During his session in front of the committee, Comerford claimed that Asda’s fuel pricing strategy policy had not changed, but the CMA found “a significant weakening of competitive pricing” from Asda. Asked if Asda were still using fire-and-rehire tactics – when an employer fires an employee and offers them a new, potentially less favourable contract – Comerford said they were “not something that Asda employs.” Jones has asked Issa to appear before the committee to discuss these concerns on 19 July. We see 5.75% peak rates by November, but absent an adverse global growth shock, rates could go higher Delaying a necessary tightening risks more ultimately needing to be delivered... ...as an increasingly domestic inflation problem risks becoming more entrenched We use two metrics to show how rates could reach 7% under some scenarios: A battle to control inflation expectations and delayed tightening is already pushing the bar higher He added: Financial markets are currently pricing in a peak in interest rates of around 6.25% by March. In other corporate news, the family-owned food giant Mars has struck a deal to buy Kevin’s Natural Foods, which makes sauces and entrée kits. The American snackmaker is reportedly paying nearly $800m for the health food brand, Reuters reported. Shaid Shah, global president at Mars Food & Nutrition, said: Leicester City FC has been fined £880,000 by the UK’s competition watchdog after admitting restricting online sales of its football kit with JD Sports. The companies had a deal in which JD agreed not to sell Leicester kit for the 2018-19 season and then said it would apply a delivery charge to all orders of Leicester City-branded clothing for the following two seasons in order not to undercut the club’s own online store. During that period JD was offering free online delivery for all orders of more than £70. JD was not fined by the CMA as it reported the illegal conduct and admitted its participation. Here is our full story on Crispin Odey: The move, pushed by the government to save costs, was confirmed by the industry body, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG). Train operators told staff on Wednesday morning of proposals to shut down almost all of the 1,007 remaining offices, except the busiest stations, within three years. It is not yet known how many jobs will be lost, though the RDG said ticket office staff would move on to station platforms and concourses in “new and engaging roles”. We want to hear from people who will be affected by the planned closures. How do you feel about the change? What will it mean for you? A senior police officer has been appointed head of the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the agency which investigates major cases of bribery and corruption. Osofsky, a former US federal prosecutor, said: The SFO has tackled some of Britain’s biggest fraud cases, including a recent high-profile case involving Swiss commodity trader Glencore. However, the agency has also been criticised in recent years over its resources and criminal disclosure rules. Despite diplomatic overtures from both sides, the competition in advanced technology between the two superpowers shows no sign of letting up. The measures came as the Biden administration reportedly prepares to expand its own restrictions on the sale of advanced microchips to China. Washington’s concerns are twofold. The first is that China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could surpass the US military in terms of overall power. The second is that it could use US technology to do so.

Private equity is failing water companies again. Get these firms back on the stock market Listing would allow the market to be admirably brutal – inflicting pain on the owners and forcing management changes By contrast, everything moves in slow motion in the murky world of non-quoted water companies. At Thames, the current dance started in June last year when the company said its owners – led by Omers, a Canadian pension fund, and the UK’s Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) – would put in an extra £1.5bn of capital. Except it was only a plan to put in more money. It is ownership by investment committee. Or, rather, ownership by several investment committees scattered around the globe with different risk appetites. It doesn’t work. Yes, the financial engineers of Macquarie, who “hollowed out” Thames and exited in 2017, are mostly to blame. But indecision seems to reign supreme among the infrastructure investors who supposedly signed up to haul Thames out of the gutter. Regulator Ofwat’s ability to force events seems extremely limited. But leisurely timeframes are par for the course. Extracting these companies from the lobster pot of over-leverage – the product of the absurd buyout boom of 2006-2008 that should never have been allowed – has been a regulatory mission for about a decade. Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion In his book about his regulatory years, Sir Ian Byatt, chairman of Ofwat from privatisation to 2000 (so before the buyout excesses), noted that he appealed as early as 1996 for the licensed companies, as opposed to holding companies, to retain a listing of some form on the stock exchange. His intention was to prevent the leakage of dividends to non-regulated activities. “My plea went unheeded,” he wrote. It wouldn’t be a cure-all, but it would be a step towards saner financing models and greater accountability, which is a bare-minimum requirement if customers are to be told to shoulder bigger bills. It would also give Labour something to say. Its current policy silence on water is embarrassing.
