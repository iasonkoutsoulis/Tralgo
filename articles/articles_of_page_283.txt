Fears grow of double-dip slump after US home sales plummet Fears intensified yesterday that the US was heading for a double dip recession that could reverberate around the world after figures showed American home sales slumped twice as fast as expected last month to a 15-year low. The main New York stock market fell through the psychologically important 10,000 level and the London exchange was also down sharply as global markets were rattled by news that sales of previously owned US homes dropped by a record 27% last month. Oil prices went into reverse and commodities declined as traders digested the news that the world's largest economy was a long way from recovery and could slip back into recession. The July drop dwarfed predictions of a 13% fall in sales expected following the withdrawal of a housebuying tax credit introduced last year to boost sales. Analysts said they would look closely at a speech later this week by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, who is expected to comment on prospects for the economy and the need for further government action to stimulate growth. Pressure on the Obama administration to adopt further measures to boost the economy are expected to intensify in the run-up to mid-term congressional elections in November. Ireland, Portugal and Spain also saw their borrowing costs jump.Martin Weale, the most recent government appointee to the Bank of England monetary policy committee, said in an interview with the Times that there was a risk of a double dip recession in the UK. He said the weakness of the recovery meant the economy could falter and anyone who ruled out the possibility of a return to negative growth was "foolish". Austerity measures will be outlined by the coalition government after the comprehensive spending review in October, which will outline how ministers plan to cut between 25% and 40% from Whitehall spending over the next five years. Concerns that Europe will follow the US back into recession also gained ground after Greek bond yields, which govern the interest rate paid by the government on its borrowing, spiralled to 11.3%. US economist Joseph Stiglitz said European governments were manufacturing a return to recession with cuts in areas that would spur recovery. He said a determination to limit government borrowing to 3% of national income was "bizarre". The Columbia University professor told Irish radio: "Cutting back willy-nilly on high-return investments just to make the picture of the deficit look better is really foolish. "Because so many in Europe are focusing on the 3% artificial number, which has no reality and is just looking at one side of a balance sheet, Europe is at risk of going into a double-dip." On the foreign exchange markets the dollar fell against most other major currencies although it was still up against the pound which was hit by Weale and Stiglitz's double-dip comments. Their warnings and fears about the US economy left investors flocking to the safe-haven of bonds. Yields on 10-year gilts in the UK were at a record low of 2.88%. Nick Beecroft, senior markets consultant at Saxo Bank, described the session as the "day the 'Sum of all Fears' took root in the mind of the market". He said: "Fears about growth in Europe, Asia and the US, where calamitous existing home sales figures were the focus … Deflation, the strength of the yen, the lingering euro zone sovereign debt problem – you name it, the market has a frightening selection of fears from which to choose." Richard Batty, investment director at Standard Life, said the US housing market data was "shocking" and showed almost nobody wanted to buy a home. The US is being closely watched for signals of troubles to come in the UK as it typically leads other economies by several months. Recent downbeat news on the US has ranged from signs that unemployment remains stubbornly high to weak activity across most business sectors. Teunis Brosens at ING Financial Markets described the July home sales reading as a headlong plunge. "These are truly dismal numbers, adding to the recent flurry of data suggesting that the recovery of the US economy is faltering," he said. . He pointed out that some of the fall was down to the expiry of a government scheme that had "artificially propped up" the market over the past year. While on paper the US housing market makes up a smaller part of the economy following the crash, new signs of stagnation are likely to dent consumer confidence. That coupled with the prospect of deflation will hit spending, economists warn. "The hard-pressed western consumer, already fearful over employment prospects and desperately trying to rebuild their balance sheet, will be the first to delay discretionary purchases of every kind if they feel they will be cheaper in a year's time," said Saxo Bank's Beecroft.

Investments head east as major markets stagnate The Jakarta Composite Index had a relatively quiet day, climbing 11.01 points, or 0.4%, to close at 3,128. But a year ago the index was worth almost a third less at 2,235. By comparison the FTSE 100 has done little more than provide day traders with mild heart failure. An index that languished at 4,800 last September moved up to 5,800 before the election only to dive again to 4,800. Today it finished up slightly at 5,234. Markets in Japan and New York have followed much the same sideways path. So what do the smaller far eastern markets have that we don't? Could it be the sparkling narrative from investment banks about a bright future built on commodities such as coal, zinc, tin and copper. Surely not when most commodities have failed to regain their April highs and slowing Chinese growth is already reversing. It must be that these markets have gained simply because they hold the promise of gains away from stagnating western markets. The vast savings of companies and wealthy individuals sloshing around the global financial system, which runs to trillions of pounds, is constantly looking for a home. It wants the highest returns. At the moment Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are among the lucky recipients. Lucky that is until someone points out share values are over inflated and bear little relation to future profits. As more money flows into markets the index rises, when investors take fright and move their money out, the indexes will collapse. For the time being, these countries will talk about their economic miracle and what great places they are for investors, but it won't last. A bubble is a bubble and before long it will burst. Brazil is talked about as the next beneficiary/victim of investor cash. It largely escaped the financial crisis and is growing strongly on the back of exports to the west. The risk comes when financial advisers identify the country as the "next big thing" and the hot money flows out of Indonesia in favour of Sau Paulo. All these countries should be wary of providing a home for investor cash when it is fickle and in the main without allegiance or scruple. Like a teen lover, it is always on the lookout for the next conquest.

City boy for a day: I was at a loss Will de Lucy and Piers Curran are the founders of Amplify, a trading house which also trains students to become traders themselves. Their hope is that graduates, older workers and even those made redundant during the recession will see trading as a chance to begin or re-launch their stuttering careers. The company offers training and internships, lasting for up to four months, which can lead to a longer-term career with Amplify, or simply help students develop a career in banking and finance. Students learn and trade using a simulated platform; if they are in profit or have not lost money on the pretend account at the end of their training, Amplify will back them with its own funds in the live markets, increasing their size and market exposure as they improve. Those who do not stay on will leave with industry-recognised professional certificates. This year, Amplify will take on about 165 trainees, while the investment banking sector as a whole has so far taken on 2,200 graduates in 2010. I enter a training room with three other journalists. We're chucked in at the deep end, bombarded with information about candlestick charts, S&P500 futures contracts, oil, the euro debt crisis, the double-dip recession and U-shaped curves. Shorting is when you sell an asset, going long is when you buy it. I switch off while Curran explains something about the reasons for the euro collapsing; instead, I begin to wonder if his suit is tailored and, if it is, how many pork bellies it would take to buy one. We are told that it takes 0.05 seconds for a trade to go live from the moment you click buy or sell. That's how quickly fortunes are made or lost. "The software needs to be fast because you need to be able to react," De Lucy explains. Later, I will see just how fast the market moves as I watch, aghast, at my mounting losses. Psychology is key. Beginners often want to exit a trade the second they achieve a decent profit, regardless of whether it's the right time or not. They do not have the confidence to stay in the market even when the signs are telling them to because they are terrified the gains they have already made could be wiped out. Similarly, if they lose money one day, they must retain their objectivity the next so that they do not begin making irrational decisions in order to recover their losses. "It's a marathon, not a sprint," warns De Lucy. Our brief lesson over, we are given three asset classes to trade with using the simulator: oil, the S&P500 and the euro/dollar. Within 15 minutes I'm down $200 (£128), mainly from trading oil. Three minutes later I turn that into a $35 profit and am staggered at how quickly money can be made or lost. After 20 minutes my profit has edged up to $47.50, but is wiped out just 60 seconds later when a bad oil short sends me $25 into the red. I begin to fall into one of the psychological traps we had been warned about. Whenever I see profit stretching above $100, my right-hand immediately reaches for the mouse and I hurriedly click "sell" to bank the gain, not having the confidence to back my positions for more than a minute or two. But it's a strategy that pays immediate dividends. After half an hour of trading I have a profit of $157.50; after 45 minutes it's $477.50 and after an hour $967.50. This is easy, I think. But it soon becomes clear that my strategy is not based on market data, studious analysis of charts or behavioural finance – I am simply guessing. For the first hour, I guess correctly and patiently build my profits. It takes just two minutes to see it all wiped out by a disastrous decision; I gamble on the oil price continuing to rise just as it collapses. A red arrow blips repeatedly on my screen, numbers tumble down it, and my profit quickly morphs into a loss of $182. We put our headsets on and listen to Curran talking to Amplify traders around the world, telling them what they should be looking out for, where the levels of support or resistance are across the indices and asset classes they trade. His disciples in Spain, Hong Kong, New York and elsewhere respond in a live chat window with messages such as, "if the euro continues to climb, yes oil can go higher". All have passed through the London offices, most as trainees. The trainees pay £1,500 for two months of training but only two or three out of 10 trainees stay with the company – the ones who display consistently good risk management. The lucky few get to keep 60% of their profits, while their losses are covered by Amplify. A newbie will be able to buy or sell just one contract a trade and will be set their own stop/loss level to ensure they can only lose a maximum of about $225 in any day. Within six months they will be given more responsibility and larger sums to play with. Given the risk controls placed on new traders, De Lucy says they can expect to earn between £2,000 and 3,000 by the third or fourth month: "If you're any good, you'll always be profitable at the end of each week." So who is best-placed to become a trader? Curran had an engineering degree when he began his career in finance more than a decade ago, while De Lucy had a degree in economics, something he says he rarely uses today. "The course is intense, so a background in finance is useful, but other degrees aren't a problem," De Lucy explains. He says good traders tend to have an entrepreneurial streak: "This is because they alone have to take responsibility for their decisions. Also, although trading itself can be very rewarding, people who need to know they have certainty and security can feel uncomfortable in this environment and this can be reflected in reduced confidence and poor-decision making in the markets." Around one in 15 applicants applies to Amplify looking for a career change, though most of these older applicants are usually already working somewhere in the finance industry. "Funnily enough, they tend to be among those who don't stay on after their training," De Lucy says. He looks over my shoulder at the computer screen and casually says that, judging by the amount of oil trades I am making, it looks like I have an "itchy trigger finger". A lot of new traders "get killed" on oil, because the price moves around a lot, he adds ominously. Each time I make a loss I feel a bit stupid and my head is filled with imagery of Depression-era bankers leaping to their doom from the roofs of Wall Street. When I make money, my confidence grows and I'm transformed into a fist-pumping, pinstripe-wearing City boy. It's exhausting. But the truth is, making money anonymously like this, with no end product except profit or loss, just doesn't motivate me. It's addictive, yes, but only in the way a computer game like Tetris might divert you for 20 minutes. Perhaps this is because I am merely playing at being a trader rather than putting expert knowledge to use. The depth of knowledge required is evident when Curran shows us a graph of Barack Obama's latest popularity rating, something I had thought would be of more interest to those involved in politics. I was wrong. Each time the president's popularity poll is updated, markets can move because of what he might do in response to regain his popularity among the American public, such as a tax-break or some kind of improved fiscal stimulus that might result in job creation and consumers returning to the shops. This in turn might stimulate economic growth and boost equity and oil prices. "The US consumer has a Pavlovian response to more money in their pockets and that is to head to the shops," De Lucy says. Then there's the behavioural finance, weather patterns, macro-economics, geo-political tensions. It all gets fed into a trader's head and is processed to inform every buy/sell decision. Analyse badly and you lose money. Analyse well and you make money. "You need to be a jack of all trades," says Curran. In the Amplify office, all this is happening at a frightening rate, with televisions blaring out financial news, traders' voices coming through headsets, numbers and ideas and comments and suggestions scrolling relentlessly across traders' screens. I find it all stressful and begin to lose confidence as I tire. "If someone isn't confident, they can begin to second-guess themselves," De Lucy says. "We call it 'trader killer', when they can't get over their fear and every decision is polluted by sentiment." Almost all new traders see a 70% dip in performance when they go from the simulation to live trading and also when they have their trading size increased. If anything were to make me want to work at Amplify long-term, it would be the people. De Lucy and Curran are likeable guys. I see De Lucy comforting and motivating a young intern who is tentatively entering the market the day after making heavy losses. He cuts through any sentiment and attempts to bring the trainee back to the basics of what he has learned and to have confidence in what he knows. It is nothing like the cut-throat, alpha-male posturing I would have expected from a City trading firm. Ironically, only a couple of journalists celebrate their trading wins with loud cries of victory. As I pose for a photographer and pretend to win outrageously on the stock market, I realise that, despite all the analysis, knowledge and training, trading is still a little like gambling, with the traders trying to stack the odds in their favour using any piece of information they can get their hands on. If it wasn't like gambling, there would be no Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, no Long-Term Capital Management bail-out, no credit crunch in 2007. How did I get on? At the end of the day, I made a profit of $580, but De Lucy tells me I made far too many trades in oil (about 170) and the trading fees have consequently turned my profit into a loss of $233. I was praised for a single trade on the S&P because I held my position for almost two hours. "Really nice patience there, which is uncommon for a new trader," he says. "It's a shame you were addicted to oil." It's clear that a trading career is not for me, but there is nothing to stop people interested in finance signing up. Even financiers who over-stretched themselves in the run-up to 2007 might learn a lot – though De Lucy and Curran might want to keep them on the simulator for longer than usual.

Safe investments to beat inflation Bank of England governor Mervyn King this week warned that the level of inflation will remain above the 2% target for much of next year and, possibly, into 2012. But what can savers do to protect their cash? Until recently, billions of pounds was pouring into National Savings & Investments' index-linked bonds, but these have been withdrawn from sale. Many in the City believe that inflation will indeed fall back in 2012, although others worry that "quantitative easing" is creating a timebomb. The man charged with picking investments for the Queen's own stockbroker, Marcus Brookes of Cazenove Capital, is focused, above all else, on protecting his clients from this problem. He puts it bluntly: "As an investor, if you get this one wrong you could be toast. If you are on the wrong side of the debate you will lose 15% to 20% of the real value of your capital in a very short time, ie, you don't protect yourself from inflation." But there is now a way to buy them from as little as £1 through an exchange-traded fund. ETFs are effectively shares which trade on the stockmarket and can be purchased through a stockbroker. They promise to match almost perfectly the price of government-issued, inflation-linked bonds and are seen as very safe. That is because the bank which creates the fund physically buys a sum of the bonds, equal to the value of the fund, and holds them for security. They can be bought and sold easily and have only a minimal annual management charge. The downside is that the ETF does not enjoy the special income tax treatment National Savings & Investment products did, but then nothing else does, either. They can be held within a tax-efficient Isa. However, you should check carefully whether the company selling the Isa, and buying the ETF, charges extra fees. While the ETF will match inflation, many people would like to be confident of beating inflation but would also be willing to take a bit more risk to gain a higher return. One way to do this is to invest not just in bonds issued by the government, but also in bonds issued by companies, known as corporate bonds. These carry the risk that if the companies issuing the bonds go bust, the investor could lose all his money.

Investing: Healthy profits highlight depth of last year's turmoil Recession, what recession? That could be the question investors are asking themselves as they study the latest set of half-year results from some of our largest companies. So does this mean we can look forward to a resumption of economic growth and, with it, a return to confidence in the anaemic stock market? Alas, probably not. The healthy profits say far more about how awful the economic outlook was this time last year than about where we will be in another 12 months. Then it looked as if we were poised for a full-blown depression and companies reacted accordingly, cutting costs and closing peripheral activities. Now that disaster has been avoided – at least temporarily – the effect of the cuts has been to boost profits dramatically. But that can only happen once; companies now need a real recovery to keep profits growing, and the chances of that look slim. The banks are no more excited about prospects. Given the scale of the write-offs which they all made against bad debts last year, it would have been astonishing if their profits in the first half of the year had not rebounded sharply. But given the plethora of regulatory inquires into everything from how they pay their counter staff, through lending levels to small businesses, to whether the investment and retail banking activities should be separated, there are plenty of clouds on their horizon. "[Profit] margins have held up well but are now close to their peak. I would question whether they will continue to achieve those margins given the economic outlook and the prospect of rising input costs [of raw materials]," he says.

Bank profits surge and send markets soaring Stock markets were buoyed on both sides of the Atlantic today as investors cheered better-than-expected profits from the banks and continued growth in manufacturing in most major economies. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, said it was important the Dow Jones managed to crack the 10,600 mark, which has been a major obstacle in the past 10 weeks. "This could be the sign that the market is finally shrugging off the pessimism that has seen stocks go broadly nowhere since early May," he said. Richard Hunter, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, Britain's largest financial adviser, said strong profits from French bank BNP Paribas and HSBC, coupled with manufacturing data showing continued growth in most major economies, had encouraged wary investors back to the market. "More than 70% of firms in the US S&P 500 index have beaten expectations so far this year. Combined with recent data showing continued economic growth, investor fears of the global economy stalling have eased. Asian markets shrugged off slowing manufacturing growth in China as a sign that the economy would avoid overheating next year. However, Hunter warned that soaring company profits, especially those of larger corporations, were becoming divorced from the wider economy in both the UK and US. "There is a disconnect between the larger companies that have already been through the pain and made redundancies and the wider economy, which is supported by government spending. With all governments looking to make steep cuts, there are obviously problems ahead." A slowdown in export orders last month hit Britain's manufacturing base, according to the latest Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI), fuelling concerns that slow growth in the eurozone and a resurgent pound would choke off a recovery in orders. UK manufacturing maintained its steady growth during July, but largely supported by domestic orders that left the index down only slightly from 57.6 at 57.3. Sluggish growth in the eurozone – expected to be around 0.5% this year – could also prove a drag on UK exports. Economists echoed Hunter's warning that the second half of 2010 could prove a difficult environment for manufacturers because of the strength of sterling, which this morning rose to a six-month high against the dollar, at $1.588. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to forecasting group the Ernst & Young Item Club, said that while the figures showed UK manufacturing continued to grow at a strong pace,the detail of the survey betrayed worrying trends: "In particular, the fact that growth in export orders appears to have stalled. It is encouraging that domestic orders have been able to offset external weakness over the past couple of months, but it would be unrealistic to expect this to continue given the headwinds that are likely to buffet the domestic sector over the next couple of years. The second quarter will probably represent the high point of quarterly manufacturing output growth, though this balance still points to growth of more than 1% for the third quarter," he said. Alan Clarke, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said: "The breakdown showed export orders fell three-quarters of a point to 50.75, the lowest since last August and down around 10 points in the last four months – a sign that a cooling-off in overseas demand is beginning to hit home." Clarke warned that the services sector, which represents the bulk of the UK economy, is a bigger risk. "This sector has seen its PMI falling for four consecutive months and is four points off the peak," he said. "Last month's services sector Markit/CIPS PMI saw the expectations component collapse, which is typically a good guide to the future evolution of the headline index. Hence Wednesday's July update will be crucial to how the more weighty services sector is likely to affect overall growth."Clarke said recent positive figures for the UK, including growth of 1.1% in the second quarter of the year, could represent a high-water mark before the economy slips back. Steep cuts in government spending and higher taxes are expected to bite later this year and into 2011. Across the eurozone, manufacturing was strongest in Germany by a wide margin – accelerating sharply to hit a three-month high. Italy saw growth accelerate to a pace matching April's post-recession peak and Spain also saw output rise at the fastest pace since April. France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Austria, on the other hand, all saw growth slow compared to post-recession peaks seen earlier in the year.

Jersey Shore cast ring Wall Street's opening bell Anway, the stock exchange enjoyed one of its most crowded days in years as Michael "the situation" Sorrentino, Pauly "DJ Pauly D" Del Vecchio, Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, Jenni "J-Woww" Farley and friends grinned from ear to ear over the trading floor. The Jersey Shore cast were on Wall Street courtesy of MTV's NYSE-listed owner, Viacom, to mark the debut of their second series in the US this week. They didn't hang around for a chat, though. On the business channel CNBC, anchor Mark Haines complained: "We often interview the ringers of the opening bell, but the Jersey Shore's handlers are not allowing them to talk. They're allowed to stand and smile, but not to talk." Wouldn't it have been fun to hear Snooki's thoughts on subprime mortgage-related derivatives?

Stock market offers opportunities to negate inflation In fact, the demand for these certificates was probably due less to a fear of rampant inflation per se, than to the fact an unexpected surge in RPI to 5% had made their interest rate – which was set at 1% above RPI depending on the term of the certificate – very attractive, particularly when it was tax free. It is impossible to find savings rates approaching that anywhere else, which means if inflation stays at this level the buying power of money left on deposit is actually being eroded. There are some other ways to inflation-proof your investments, however. The closest alternative to the withdrawn certificates are index-linked gilts – government-issued bonds which track RPI. But unlike NS&I products these have not been overly popular – their return so far this year is the lowest of all government bonds. And unlike NS&I there is no guarantee you will get your money back – the price of all gilts will rise and fall depending on investor sentiment. Unfortunately, the same is true of the other main way of inflation-proofing your portfolio: investing in the stock market. While, over the long term, the return on shares is well ahead of inflation, the time horizon is key – as anyone who has endured a dismal performance on equities over the past decade will testify. While many strategists argue that stock markets currently look attractive on a long-term view, uncertainty in the economy means share prices could just as easily fall significantly before they start moving up again. Those who are prepared to take that risk can put together a portfolio of companies that not only offers a reasonable income now, but will continue to do well – and, therefore, pay increasing dividends – regardless of the level of inflation. It is possible to put together a portfolio of companies which yield far more than that. Individual shares such as Vodafone, bus operator FirstGroup, National Grid and Standard Life all yield more than 6%. And there are a few companies which have managed to grow their dividends every year for more than a decade – Tesco, Morrisons and British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco among them. Killik & Co recommends a portfolio of 10 companies, all of which currently pay good dividends with the potential for further growth and which, crucially, also have what is called good dividend cover. This means their annual earnings are substantially more than their annual dividends so they have the scope to continue paying, or even increasing, dividends even if their earnings stagnate or fall. These companies are Vodafone, FirstGroup, GlaxoSmithKline, BAT, AstraZeneca, J Sainsbury plc, Centrica, Halfords, Pearson and Melrose. This would be a diverse portfolio covering a range of sectors and company sizes. But investors would need a substantial sum of money to buy into them all – and the fewer shares you buy, the bigger the risk to your money should one of them go wrong.

Europe's bank stress tests - as it happened It's judgement day for Europe's banks. In the next few hours the European Union will publish full details of the health checks that have been conducted on major and minor financial institutions across the region. These test have the power to reassure investors that the banking sector is in robust shape, or spark a new wave of panic. While there has been concern in the markets that if enough banks do not fail the stress tests they will not prove to be credible, Credit Suisse analysts also point out that many banks in the 27 EU countries have already raised funds – including in Greece, Spain and Ireland, whose economy has been crippled by the property downturn. The market is comparing the EU tests to the one conducted by the US in May 2009, when 10 large banks needed to raise $65bn (£43bn) of fresh funds. The Credit Suisse experts point out the European banking sector has already been bolstered by €200bn (£170bn) since then. As Cyclos Securities analyst Constantinos Vergos put it: "The market expects that ATEbank will need to recapitalise after this afternoon's stress test results." As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, ATEBank is also a likely casualty as it has been used to inject funds into Greece's farming sector for many years - and many of those loans have been defaulted on. Its Banks team and European Portfolio Strategy team canvassed 386 experts, and has concluded that 10 banks will fail the tests today. That is a bigger strike rate than we'd been expecting. Goldman also reckons that the tests will show a shortfall of €38bn. Digging into the survey, there are some outlying forecasts - with a few participants saying that at least 20 banks could fail. At the other end of the graph, some people think you'll be able to count the failures on the fingers of one hand. As Goldman puts it: "there appears to be very little consensus about the outcome, how much will be raised and what the impact will be." Tumpel-Gugerell also told the European Economics and Financial Centre that: It is important to remember that the markets are still acting cautiously in the build-up to the Bank Stress Test results and that the currency markets are likely to fluctuate after 5pm today. That's the verdict of Ralph Silva, director of Silva Research Network. He has predicted that the banks will dodge the issue by simply claiming that they will recapitalise themselves from another bank based in another country in the event of a crisis. Silva also questioned the timing of the tests: "You don't ask someone to run a marathon a week after they broke their leg. We are stress testing the banks in a position where they are recovering," he said. "By doing these stress tests what we are in fact doing is highlighting the problems that are going to stop them from lending instead of encouraging them to lend," Silva added. It's also worth noting that if everyone passes, the tests won't have much validity. Some banks has to fail to prove the tests are rigorous, basically, but not too many as to suggest the whole sector is shot. Although they are thought to assume a theoretical 25% drop in the value of relevant government bonds (eg, the price at which they are traded between investors), they don't actually include the possibility of a European country actually defaulting on its debts. The European Commission, for instance, is trying to calm fears that its decision to allow Spain and Portugal to extend state support to their banks until the end of the year is NOT related to the stress tests. The commission's decision to make the announcement today - just hours ahead of the results of the stress tests - had raised alarm in the markets that Europe's regulators were rushing to put in safety measures ahead of news that banks in the two countries had failed the tests. But a Commission spokesman told Reuters: "The timing of this is completely unrelated to the publication of stress tests later today." Now Moody's has its eyes on Hungary after it ended talks with the IMF and EU on a €20bn (£17bn) aid deal. Hungarian premier Victor Orban has said he will no longer negotiate with the IMF as he intends to restore the country's "lost economic self-rule". The credit ratings agency, however, believes Budapest should commit to the budget deficit targets and accept international help. It has placed Hungary's Baa1 local and foreign currency government bond ratings on review for a possible downgrade. "Moody's decision to initiate this review was prompted by the increased uncertainty regarding Hungary's fiscal outlook and economic prospects," the agency said. "This uncertainty is the result of the recent breakdown of Hungary's talks with the IMF and EU." Standard & Poor's said later that it has revised its outlook on Hungary to negative from stable. It has a BBB-/A-3 rating on the country, which is already lower than Moody's. Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said the tests assume government debt prices fall back to the levels seen at the start of May - at the height of the euro zone crisis - and remain there. "Also, that the debt crisis is transmitted to the loan books of the banking system," he added. A total of 61 banks are in the report, compared with 91 undertaking the test, because some of the smaller banks don't trade, or rarely trade, in the CDS market. Markit concludes: Looking at the tables, it is no surprise to see that the majority of the riskiest banks are in the eurozone's periphery – Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. These banks have direct exposure to sovereign risk through their holdings of government bonds. They are also exposed to slowing domestic economies brought about by fiscal austerity. "The haircuts are applied to the trading book portfolios only, as no default assumption was considered," according to a confidential document dated July 22 and titled "EU Stress Test Exercise: Key Messages on Methodological Issues." The tests will assume a loss of 23.1% on Greek debt, 14% of Portuguese bonds, 12.3% on Spanish debt, and 4.7% on German state debt while UK government bonds will be subject to a 10% haircut, and France 5.9%. The methodology behind the tests has been released ahead of the actual results of the tests at 5PM London time (1600GMT) in an effort to show how tough the tests really were. Banks failed the test if they were unable to maintain a tier 1 capital ratio of 6% under each scenario. The scenarios used to test Europe's banks were tougher, according to EU regulators and the CEBS, than the scenarios used in last year's stress tests in the US. The European scenarios have a likelihood of happening once every two decades while the US ones could occur once every seven years. The European tests assumed that the European economy would shrink by 3% over 2010 and 2011, with stockmarkets, plunging 20% in both years – a compound loss of 36%. Credit ratings on securitised products, meanwhile, dropped four notches, although – as reported earlier – losses on sovereign debt holdings applied only to bonds the banks traded, not those that they held to maturity. The euro is still down around fell half a cent against the dollar at $1.2820 after news of the methodology behind the stress tests broke. It seems the real worry is about the scenarios employed for losses on sovereign debt. Firstly, there seems to be some anxiety about whether the 23% "haircut" applied to Greek debt is really large enough and secondly, the fact the fall in price was only applied to holdings in trading books rather than banking books matters to the market. This is because bonds that banks hold to maturity in their banking books will not the subjected to the test. So any analyst who feels unsatisfied by the haircuts only being applied to trading positions will be able to do their own maths. The Bank of Portugal has declared that all the Portugese banks have passed the tests Nothing on the actual CEBS web site yet, though.... That was largely expected - the shock will be if another German bank has also failed. Meanwhile the full report is now up on the CEBS site - with an "executive summary" that covers 55 pages. There'll be some long shifts being pulled in the City tonight..... The testing found that ATEbank would have a Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.36% under the most adverse scenario, leaving it short of €242.6m. There's clearly massive interest in these tests, as the CEBS website is wobbling and appeared to crash just then. Seems to be working OK now - don't all click at once. I've seen nothing stressful about this test. It's like sending the banks away for a weekend of R&R. The euro has been fluctuating since the tests came out, and is now down again at $1.2831. The results suggest (on the face of it), that Britain's banks are in good shape. Here are their Tier 1 capital ratios under the most adverse scenario: As you can see, the "sovereign stress" part of the exercise simulated a run on government debt, but only considered the impact on a bank's trading operations. So (as mentioned earlier today), the tests explicitely do not consider a European country defaulting on its debts. The objective of the CEBS exercise is to undertake an assessment of the strength of EU banks in a consistent manner across institutions and countries. It focused on three different scenarios; a benchmark stress, a more adverse macro-economic stress and a country-wide stress. The benchmark stress identifies movements in parameters such as GDP, unemployment and interest rates and charts a mild deviation away from the pathway which the economy is currently on: it then makes conservative assumptions about the loan losses which will result in this macro-economic scenario. This helps to set a benchmark (mildly stressed scenario) against which the more adverse stress is then applied. The adverse stress assumes a 3 percentage point deviation of GDP for the EU compared to the European Commission's forecasts over the two-year time horizon. The method of translating this scenario to loss rates is also conservative. A further 'sovereign stress' was then applied. This tested the resilience of banks to an increase in the yields of government bonds issued by EU member states. It simulates, (i) the associated medium term uptick in household and corporate sector loan losses in the banking book, and (ii) immediate mark to market losses arising from trading book holdings of government bonds of each country. The actual exposures of each bank to central and local government across the EU have been published by each bank. Results identify the simulated Tier 1 ratios of European banks as well as specific simulations for profit and loss measures. The CEBS results are focused on Tier 1 ratios for comparability across the EU. As expected the outcomes of the stresses demonstrate the preparedness and resilience of the UK banks under unlikely adverse economic scenarios. The FSA has published the high level results for the UK banks. This resilience is a result of the considerable work that has been undertaken to strengthen UK banks in recent years. The CEBS stress test is different but complementary to the FSA's stress testing regime. The long awaited bank stress tests do not seem to have been that stressful after all. This is not surprising. The last thing the authorities would have wanted to do was to set a series of assumptions that would have led to a broad failure across the Euro area, as this could only do more damage to the already frail markets. The most controversial area surrounds the treatment of the banks Sovereign debt holdings. The haircuts on these bonds only applied to the banks trading books, whereas the majority of these bonds are held on the banking books. In some ways this is consistent with the EU's comments that no EU sovereign will be allowed to fail, although of course if there is a Sovereign failure at a later date where the debt is held will make no difference to the actual loss that would be taken. Jenkins also argues that it would be a mistake to think that the seven banks which failed today would be allowed to go under "in the real world": They will no doubt either raise capital from the private sector or more likely from their respective governments, as no-one is prepared to undertake another Lehmans like experiment. In conclusion, Jenkins reckons the stress tests will soon be forgotten: My view is that whilst the stress tests do not take into account the worst case scenario of multiple sovereign failures, we know what the impact of such a disastrous backdrop would be anyway; that is a complete collapse of the western worlds financial system! The EU governments will not allow banks to actually fail in the market, thus it is the sovereign bond market that is key in the short term, because there is not anyone who can bail out the governments (aside from printing money). Who they, I hear you mutter. It's Hungary's largest bank, of course. The presence of a Hungarian lender at the top of the list might be slightly embarrassing for the EU, though, given Hungary's particular problems - talks with the International Monetary Fund and the EU broke down last week, which means a €20bn loan programme has been suspended Only this morning, ratings agency Moody's warned it might downgrade Hungary, pointing to its weak economy as well as its wrangles with the IMF. As they point out, ATEBank of Greece has the lowest capital ratios of any of the Greek banks being tested. It's 77% owned by the Greek state and has long been saddled with problem loans and businesses relating to its role as government lender to the farm sector. Hypo Real Estate of Germany has been nationalized since 2009 after requiring more than €102 billion in loans and state guarantees after it and its Irish unit Depfa PLC were heavily hit by the financial crisis. It is already being split into a Good bank and Bad bank - something the stress tests didn't take into account. The five Spanish savings banks, known as cajas, had all suffered from the collapse of Spain's property bubble. As promised almost two hours ago, here's the breakdown of how their tier 1 ratios came in (against the target of 6% or higher): City analysts are still digging through the data, so we may have more developments tonight. But if not, thanks for reading.

Markets nervous ahead of bank stress test results Several of Spain's 18 cajas, including some that have been merged recently, have failed the tests that examine how they would cope with worsening economic conditions. El País newspaper reported that some of the unlisted savings banks would need more capital if the economy were to worsen sharply and there were sovereign debt crises in several countries. Analysts also believe that Greek banks – weakened after the bailout of the country by the International Monetary Fund – as well as German regional banks, known as Landesbanken, are vulnerable. The Landesbanken have yet to account for losses incurred in the wake of writedowns on securitised assets such as collateralised debt obligations. But Manfred Weber, the head of the Association of German Banks, told local radio this morning that he was confident that German banks would "all in all" perform well in the tests. "The markets need to view the tests as being credible to remove any fears about the European banking system," said Raghav Subbarao, a currency strategist at Barclays Capital. "Too few banks failing would lead to the tests not being viewed as credible while too many failures will raise further concerns about the state of the banking system. It is going to be hard to pull off the right balance of successful and failed banks." KBW has run its own stress test on banks that are listed across Europe. According to this, 10 banks are likely to fall below the 6% tier one capital ratio and would need to raise €9.8bn (£8.2bn) – although the number would be much higher if unlisted institutions were added. The banks that would fail the KBW stress test – assuming that dividends would be cut to help preserve capital – are Greek banks National Bank of Greece, Piraeus, EFG, Marfin and Alpha Bank, Portugal's BPI, Germany's Deutsche Post Bank, Italy's Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena, Bank of Ireland and Turkey's BKT. Markets are comparing the EU tests to the one conducted by the US in May 2009, when 10 large banks needed to raise $65bn (£43bn) of fresh funds. Experts at Credit Suisse point out the European banking sector has already been bolstered by €200bn since then. There are concerns that the banks are being asked to hold more capital at a time when they have been asked by governments to increase lending to households and businesses.

Cack-handed cashback for Ocado This remarkable opportunity flows from Ocado's cack-handed progress towards flotation. Having berated the world for failing to "get it", the company has had to capitulate and admit that the sceptics are too numerous and the price of the shares must be cut beyond the original range. To ensure fair treatment of customers (wise if you're hoping to retain their custom), the Friday get-out clause has been inserted to keep the timetable on track. The confusion is entirely of Ocado's making. The company was asking for trouble in pricing itself at £1bn-plus, given that it was knocking out shares at half that valuation in a private placing last October. Nothing had happened in the past nine months to justify such an increase. What's more, the decision to hire eight banks as advisers backfired. Investors detected an arrogant attempt to quash dissent – an impression reinforced by those "they don't get it" remarks. Future flotation candidates probably won't repeat the trick of hiring a battalion of bankers, so at least the drama should have one lasting benefit. The view here is that the shares are still not cheap enough. Ocado has some smart technology, loyal customers and helpful market trends. But these advantages do not yet add up to profitability and it is too hard to judge when an adequate return on capital will be earned. The investment gamble would look more reasonable if another £300m was knocked off the asking price. In that sense, Ocado has actually done well to float at £895m. But, blimey, what a roundabout route to take.

Ocado stock market flotation '80% subscribed' with one day to deadline Ocado management will tomorrow embark on a final round of back-to-back meetings with potential investors, as the deadline approaches to price shares in the online grocer's stock market flotation. Sources close to the company tonight claimed Ocado had orders for around 80% of the shares on offer and insisted that the failure to cover the entire equity on offer with only a day to go was not unusual. The offer is expected to be priced tomorrow night at the lower end of the 200p-275p price range, valuing the business at around £800m. Conditional trading begins on Wednesday, while the company will be fully listed on Monday, assuming the directors manage to shift the remaining shares. The company is looking to raise £200m to plough into the business, while existing investors are selling another £200m of equity. The flotation has been beset by critics who have argued the company, yet to record a profit after a decade in business, has been over-valued. Last year it lost £14.4m on sales of £402m. Clive Black at Shore Capital described the £1.1bn price tag as "stratospheric". Finance director Andrew Bracey said over the weekend that "several thousand" Ocado customers had bought shares, around 3% of the eligible base, and denied the take-up had been a disappointment.

Wall Street: The banks are still boss

Brian Myerson braced to lose battle for control of D1 Oils Elsewhere, in further signs that many in the City were shunning the colourful investor, Myerson resigned directorships at department store group Liberty and Sirius, a German real estate group listed on the Alternative Investment Market. However, uncowed by the panel's rebuke, Principle Capital – where Myerson remains executive chairman and major investor – is pressing ahead with an extraordinary general meeting it has called on Monday at Aim-listed D1, in which it holds a 27.5% stake. Principle Capital is calling for the current board to be replaced by two of its representatives. Myerson believes D1, which has repeatedly sought additional shareholder funds to keep the business alive, has no realistic future as an independent entity. He wants it to be sold off or broken up and its cash pile returned to investors. While the company claims to be discussing a sale, Myerson has lost patience and is pressing ahead with the meeting, calling for the board to be sacked. He had previously sought to reverse another of his interests, Principle Energy, a sugar-cane biofuels group with operations in Southern Africa, into D1, but his ambitions had been blocked by the board and a large number of shareholders. Yesterday the besieged D1 board issued a statement to investors highlighting the Takeover Panel ruling against Myerson, saying: "Under the circumstances the board believes it is inappropriate for representatives of Principle Capital to be appointed to the board or for current members of the board to be removed." Principle Capital responded: "We view the statement as a cheap shot by a management that is desperate to cling on at any cost. This management has presided over a catastrophic destruction of value at D1." Myerson's cold-shoulder punishment relates to an unconnected power struggle last year at Principle Capital, which at the time was listed on Aim. Myerson and associates were said to have acted in concert, breaching the panel's takeover code, and to have later given explanations that were "co-ordinated, disingenuous and dishonest". The three-year cold shoulder is supposed to be the City equivalent of an Asbo, in effect barring Myerson from takeover situations. But Principle Capital, which was subsequently been taken private, believes the punishment does not extend to it, despite Myerson remaining executive chairman and a major investor. Regulatory sources would not be drawn on whether Principle Capital was covered by the cold-shoulder order. Myerson has already failed to overturn the panel finding against him on appeal but continues to argue that it is flawed and is considering taking his case to the European courts.

Flotations are not being sunk by 'market forces' Where does this leave Ocado? Commendably, the online supermarket surrendered the "market conditions" card when it declared itself so unique that squalls were irrelevant. Either there are buyers out there for £400m of stock at 200p-275p or there are not. If it's the latter, Ocado should cut the price or come back when it's made a profit. But it's pointless telling City analysts that they don't "get it" – everybody is free to shop elsewhere.

Ocado optimistic despite Fairfield Energy's abandoned flotation Fairfield Energy, a private-equity backed North Sea oil business which specialises in extracting hard-to-access oil from mature fields, had been hoping to raise £330m, but its offer has been spurned by investors. In a one-line statement this morning, Fairfield said that, "in the light of market conditions, it has decided against proceeding with its initial public offering of shares and listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange at this time." Ocado shares are being offered in the price range of 200-275p and private investors must get their applications in by midnight on Sunday. Institutional investors have until next Tuesday, but privately, many have made it clear they have no intention of buying shares, insisting the business is worth nowhere near £1bn. Ocado's senior management is currently on a marketing roadshow in the US to persuade American investors to buy shares and its directors are in a blackout period, unable to comment on how the sale process is going. But, last night, a source close to the company insisted Fairfield's failure was irrelevant: "It's an oil well in the North Sea. It is a depleting asset and a finite resource." He said the grocer's directors were "really bored" with what they believed was negative media coverage and that they remained "pretty confident" they would get their float away. Several high-profile City retail analysts have questioned the valuation of the Ocado business. Earlier this week, Clive Black, of Shore Capital, described the price tag as "stratospheric". He added: "It is little short of ludicrous to suggest otherwise" and is urging investors not to buy the shares – and to consider shorting them to make money if the price declines. Greg Lawless, of Collins Stewart, believes the shares could be worth just 128p each, while Nick Bubb, of Arden Partners, has suggested the Ocado bosses consider "a face-saving cut in the price to 160-180p". A source close to the grocery company said the analysts do not "get it" because they are used to assessing the prospects of traditional high street retailers rather than new online business models such as Ocado. He added that overseas investors had given the company "an amazing reception".

Ocado flotation fears grow as oil firm's listing heads for collapse Fairfield Energy, a private-equity backed North Sea oil business which was hoping to raise £330m, has been spurned by investors. A board meeting was taking place tonight and, barring a last-minute rush for the shares, the float is expected to be formally abandoned tomorrow morning. The company, which specialises in extracting hard-to-access oil from mature fields, is expected to blame the current jittery state of global markets and anxiety among potential investors for its decision to pull the float. Ocado, which is aiming for a valuation of more than £1bn, is attempting to raise £400m from many of the same investors. Ocado shares are being offered in the price range of 200-275p and private investors must get their applications in by midnight on Sunday. Institutional investors have until next Tuesday, but privately, many have made it clear they have no intention of buying shares, insisting the business is worth nowhere near £1bn.

European bank shares rise on economic recovery optimism, low UK rates Renewed optimism about global economic recovery lifted bank shares throughout Europe, pushing stock market indexes into gains. The FT-SE 100 added 90 points, or 1.8%, to 5,105 points, also helped by the Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates at 0.5%. Hopes that cheap money will fuel demand for bank loans and consumption sent Lloyds Bank up 4.3%, or 2.5 pence, to 60.99p. Royal Bank of Scotland gained 1.5p, or 3.5%, 44.3p, while Barclays added 10.4p, or 3.5%, to 301.5p. "The UK economy is still extremely fragile, and with a severe fiscal tightening on the way it is essential for monetary policy to support the recovery," said Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. The market also cheered news showing that Britain's manufacturing output grew at the fastest rate in nearly 16 years in May, following heavy downward revisions to April's numbers. European bank shares rose, boosted by the emergence of the first details of the EU stress tests -perceived to be less tough than expected. As many as 91 European banks will be tested on their ability to resist a financial shock, and may be asked to increase their capital buffers if appropriate. Confidence in that the tests will reassure investors over the Spanish banking system sent the price to protect $10bn of Spanish debt down by $15,000, to $232,000, an indication that investors have eased their fears about Spain following Greece into a bail-out. In Madrid, Banco Santander rose 1.4% to €9.9. Man Group, the world's largest quoted hedge fund, said assets under management fell by 2.3% during its fiscal first quarter to $38.5bn. The shares, which have plunged by one third over the past six months, rose by 0.6%, or 1.3p, to 222.5p, as institutional investors, such as pension funds, withdrew less funds than expected. Redemptions reached $0.6bn, "the lowest absolute quarterly level for three years," the company said. Insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor Group rose 1.2% to 60p after posting buoyant annual results, boosted by its growing number of distressed clients. The firm, which provides administration and restructuring services, said full-year pre-tax profit from continuing operations, surged by 20% to £8.7m. The economic recession and a drought of traditional bank lending have pushed hundreds of businesses into insolvency as they struggled to meet interest payments.

Stock market analysts square up: Will the bears or bulls triumph? "The government has bought easy answers with more and more credit but that's over now – there is too much debt and they cannot borrow anymore. We're dealing with much deeper change than most people realise." Gilts are bonds issued and backed by the government, offering almost zero risk (unless the government goes bust, something more cynical readers may believe to be imminent). When you invest in gilts you are effectively lending money to the government, which promises to pay you back the full amount (the principal) at a set date, along with interest (the coupon). All gilts are issued at 100p but can be traded, so you can sell or buy them before their redemption date for a potential gain or loss. Gilt yields rise and fall in line with the Bank of England base rate, but if you buy and hold you know exactly where you stand for both income and capital. "The fact is, while you can worry about growth in China – it is so full of holes it's like an Aero bar – the Eurozone or the US, the long-term picture will tell you that a balanced portfolio across all asset classes (equities, bonds, gilts, property, commodities) should see investors alright, even if it is a bit dull; not equities alone, not gilts alone, but everything together. His colleague Ted Scott, manager of the F&C UK Growth & Income fund, says that a shift in assets (from equities to bonds) is "entirely rational as expectations on the shape of the recovery were too bullish. In the UK, the nature of the budget has reinforced this as it is largely positive for bonds and negative for equities." Lees agrees that it is the right time to reduce risk in equity portfolios, especially as most financial and cyclical companies are on "quite demanding valuations". But in a recent statement he did support the likes of Imperial Tobacco, Glaxo and Capita in the large-cap arena, along with "old favourites" such as Domino's Pizza and Connaught lower down the market. Lees says they are good examples of companies with resilient earnings growth, strong balance sheets and, in many cases, attractive and growing dividends. More importantly, they lagged the market as it briefly rallied earlier this year. Dermott Whelan of independent financial adviser Informed Choices agrees there is a lot of uncertainty across asset classes and says their recommended portfolio would actually be underweight in gilts. "We have concerns that demand for gilts will be scarcer this year than it has been over the previous 12 months," he says. "It was the system of quantitative easing that previously bought up much of the gilt issuance and we cannot rely on that to happen again this year, particularly with continued fears about inflation." That said, he suggests portfolios should be overweight in index-linked gilts while uncertainty remains about the future of UK inflation. As for equities, Whelan suggests being overweight in European shares. "We believe that the euro will survive the current crisis, although it may remain weak for some time yet. This would be positive for European exporters, so overseas earnings should help to fund economic growth in Europe, particularly if demand is there from the growth in emerging market economies." He remains neutral on UK and American equities but likes the look of Asian (excluding Japan) equities because "these economies are generating growth well in excess of developed Western economies."

FTSE slides after Moody's threatens to downgrade Spain Shares in London fell to their lowest level in nearly 10 months this morning amid fears that Spain was about to be pulled deeper into the European debt crisis. Last night, rating agency Moody's alarmed the financial markets by announcing that it has put Spain's AAA sovereign rating on review for "possible downgrade". It said that the country's economic prospects are deteriorating, at a time when its government is attempting to cut its deficit. Moody's will now evaluate Spain's credit rating again, over the next three months. It said it expects that any cut would only be by "one, or at most two, notches". The EBC is calling in €442bn of loans made a year ago at the height of the financial crisis, so the markets are keen to learn whether institutions now have to lean heavily on its six-day lending facility. Yesterday they borrowed a total of €131.9bn in 3 months funding, less than feared. According to Gary Jenkins of Evolution Securities, this may be a sign that the banks have lost their appetite for buying government bonds, which they had financed with cheap money from the ECB: A year ago the opportunity to borrow significant sums of money from the ECB at 1% was probably seen by many institutions as an opportunity to put a "risk free" trade on where they used the ECB cash to purchase longer dated government bonds and then took the turn. A nice little earner on the face of it. However as we know that has not turned out to be the case and in reality the banks have probably been preparing for the expiry of the €442bn facility by selling some of the assets that they purchased with it in the first place.
