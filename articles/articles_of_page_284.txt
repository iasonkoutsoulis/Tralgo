Hut Group prepares to float on back of VAT loophole The Hut Group, the fast-growing firm behind controversial VAT-free CD and DVD internet sales for Asda, WHSmith, Dixons, Argos and Woolworths, has begun rapidly expanding into other product areas – including cheap handbags, jewellery, novelty gifts, sun cream and underwear – as it builds towards a stock market flotation early next year. New websites gifted.com, mybag.co.uk and washbag.com have been launched in the past three months. The move is a bold departure for the Cheshire-based business, which has grown into Britain's third-largest online DVD and CD retailer in the six years since it was set up by Matthew Moulding and John Gallemore, former executives within John Caudwell's mobile phone empire. By basing much of certain operations in the Channel Islands, the Hut Group exploits a loophole in 27-year-old European tax rules that exempts from VAT any imports below £18 in value arriving from outside the EU. With VAT scheduled to rise from 17.5% to 20% at the end of the year, the appeal of tax-free internet sales is expected to become stronger than ever. The Treasury has been said to be keeping Channel Islands VAT-free trade under "close review" and the new government has yet to look at the matter. Data from Kantar market research suggests one in three music CD purchases in the run-up to last Christmas were at VAT-free prices via the internet. Among those offering the customers the internet tax dodge are Tesco, HMV Amazon and Play.com.

Ocado hopes for £1bn valuation on float The loss-making business, which was set up in 2000 and made its first delivery in 2002, also announced improved financial results today. Its finance director, Andrew Bracey, said that revenue was up 29% in the most recent six months and earnings before financial charges were ahead 181% at £8m. Ocado has never made a bottom-line profit. It took more than 100,000 orders in a single week for the first time during May, with 6% of orders now coming through the Ocado iPhone app. The company, which has just over £100m of debt, expects to have a £1bn enterprise value at the float. After the share offer, its equity should be valued at £1.1bn. That valuation would be more than double last year's gross sales of £427m. The bulk of Ocado's customers are inside the M25, although it delivers to towns as far north as Harrogate. It intends to use the bulk of the proceeds of the float to finance a new warehouse and is looking at sites in the Midlands. About £45m will be used to pay down debt. The company said that it had "a significant market opportunity" because the grocery sector is the biggest in retail but has the lowest level of online shopping. It added that it had identified growth opportunities for selling non-food ranges "such as baby [products], health and beauty and kitchenware" and also saw opportunities to replicate the business overseas. Bracey said: "We believe now is an ideal time in Ocado's development for it to fund the growth and expansion of the business by raising capital in a flotation." He has signed up eight banks to advise on the flotation. Two of them, said Bracey, "have good research and write well", while others have been brought in "to say thank you for stuff they have done in the past". The float advisers will share fees of about £15m. Ocado's planned float is far from a guaranteed success. SuperGroup – which owns the Superdry fashion label and retail chain – floated in March at 500p and today the shares closed up 23p at 733p. However, the rival fashion group New Look was forced to abandon its plans for a float amid gyrating markets and after investors rejected the idea of supplying cash that was to be used largely to repay debt. Philip Dorgan, retail analyst at Ambrian, has described Ocado as "snake oil" and said: "Ocado starts with an 'o', ends with an 'o' and is worth zero." Clive Black at Shore Capital said he "balked" at the £1bn valuation, which had "no bearing whatsoever to a sensible earnings multiple ... given ongoing losses [and] micro profits".

Battersea power station fires up for London stock market listing Despite numerous plans for the 40-acre site, it has stood empty for more than a quarter of a century while the rest of the Thames waterfront around it has undergone huge change. REO has been hit hard by the Irish property slump. It reported an underlying loss before tax of nearly £1bn for the 14 months to 28 February, reflecting an £811m drop in the valuation of its property portfolio. The firm has drawn up a shortlist of possible investors after being approached by a number of international real estate groups, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds from around the world, including the Middle East. REO hopes to get permission to redevelop the site in September after submitting the largest ever planning application made in central London, in terms of financial value, last autumn. If it gets the go-ahead, the site's value is expected to soar from the current valuation of £388m. Treasury Holdings was forced to tear up its plans for the imposing building, one of London's most recognisable landmarks, and start again after Johnson decided that a proposed tower would ruin the view from Waterloo Bridge to the Palace of Westminster. The original plan, drawn up by the New York-based architect Rafael Viñoly, included a futuristic 300m glass funnel and atrium, rising from an enormous transparent dome. Viñoly and Treasury Holdings came up with a new blueprint a year ago that is capped at a height of 60m, as stipulated by the mayor. It includes 3,700 homes, office space, shops, restaurants and leisure facilities, at a cost of £4.5bn. Treasury Holdings also hopes to co-fund an extension of London Underground's Northern Line to the site. The high cost means the company needs a partner – "someone who can bring big financial strength to it to make sure it happens," said Tincknell. Building work could start at the end of 2011. When the power station was decommissioned in 1983, its then owners, the Central Electricity Generating Board, wanted to tear down the building and replace it with housing, but it had been given a Grade II listing in 1980. For developers, the real prize is the land around it; most have little interest in its heritage status.

Record drop in new US home sales unnerves investors The stock market decline is accelerating after disappointing US new home sales, which fell to a record low and renewed fears that the economy recovery was slowing. After poor existing home sales yesterday, sales of new single family homes fell 32.7% in May to 300,000, the lowest level since the survey started in 1963. Analysts had been expecting a decline of around 14%. Following the expiry of the homebuyer tax credit, May new home sales came in one third lower. At first sight, this is awful. But a marked drop in new home sales was to be expected. New home sales capture deal signings. Deals had to be signed by 30 April to qualify for the homebuyer tax credit. This has pulled forward demand, and caused a demand fallout in May.

Deepwater oil drilling under scrutiny as Brazil's Petrobas delays flotation Brazil's national oil company Petrobras has surprised investors by postponing its $25bn (£16.86bn) stock market flotation, potentially delaying its efforts to extract oil from deepwater reserves off the coast. The Petrobras stock offering, which had been scheduled for July, will now be delayed by two months until September. It blamed the move on Brazil's ANP energy regulator, which needs more time to assess the value of oil reserves which lie deep below the seabed off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The flotation of Petrobras is a key part of the country's efforts to extract huge quantities of high-quality oil which lie around 280 miles offshore. These reserves are trapped around 4,000 metres under the sea floor, beneath layers of salt and rock. There is also around 2,000 metres of seawater between the seabed and the surface, further complicating the drilling process. Under Petrobras's flotation plan, the government would sell the company the right to extract 5bn barrels of oil in reserves currently under the state's control, and would receive an equal share of the listed company in return. The first of Brazil's massive pre-salt oil fields, Tupi, was discovered in 2007. It contains between 5bn and 8bn barrels of oil, triggering fevered speculation that the country had suddenly become a major player in the world energy market. Other fields have since been discovered, pushing up the total estimates size of the reserves to around 30bn barrels – roughly the entire world oil consumption in 2010. But environmental activists are deeply concerned that extracting the oil will be dangerous, as it is even deeper than BP's Macondo field. Last week the Global Renewable Fuels Alliance (GRFA) named Brazil's Tupi field as one of the 10 most dangerous offshore sites in the world. "Drilling through the salt layer will create significant risks," the GRFA warned. The Brazilian government is committed to exploiting the pre-salt oil fields. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wants to use the reserves to cut poverty in the country and improve its education system.

Online investing and women "Gone are the days when online investing was completely dominated by men," says Edward Croft, chief executive of Stockopedia. "There are increasing numbers of smart, savvy women out there who are taking up the challenge of making their own investment decisions. "They are showing that the traditional route of giving full control of your portfolio to an arms-length investment adviser is not the only choice." Many of the women who have turned to share trading have done so very recently. Selftrade's figures show that the proportion of investors using its site that are women jumped from 24% to 34% in just two years. The increasing availability of information and share services online has helped fuel this trend. It has also shifted the emphasis away from affluent individuals and City workers. However, as diverse as the investing community may be, many recent investors have taken the plunge because they have been dissatisfied by the performance of their more traditional investments. So, who are the new female investors? Samina is a typical mum of three kids, aged eight, four and two. She is run off her feet and juggles the school run, nursery and childcare, and working four days a week as a debt recovery officer. Samina has always saved. She was prompted to take the plunge into buying and selling shares after her two endowment policies – with Legal & General and Friends Provident – performed so badly. "I just didn't make anything on them. There was no point in doing them. I'm better off self-investing," she says. Her disappointment in the performance of her investments came at the same time as she faced problems in her marriage, exacerbating the need for her to exert greater financial control. "There was a time when I didn't mind someone else investing my money on my behalf, but I've had some issues – marital problems etc – so, financially, I need to be secure now. I'm much more conscious of the need to plan ahead and I've realised I need more control over what I'm doing." Samina has been encouraged by her stepfather, Zahid, who has bought and sold shares for as long as she can remember, and has provided her with much appreciated guidance. In the past year, Samina's confidence in her own investing ability has grown. Now, instead of just buying and holding shares, she has taken the plunge and sold shares and changed the weighting of her portfolio as the markets have changed. "At the moment, I'm just invested in UK shares, mainly in power companies and energy providers, but I'm also looking to invest in US markets. "I could trade a lot more than I do, but if I traded more I'd need to do more research, and I don't have the time for that. I'm doing this to plan for my future, as well, not just for the kids." Samina's confidence has grown so much, thanks to the encouragement of Zahid, that she has now become an advocate of investing and has persuaded one of her friends to take up her hobby. "My friend is the same age – she's 41 – with kids the same age. She's a training manager with the civil service, but I've persuaded her, and she now buys shares. The risks are high but it's the best way to make some money grow if you've got the balls for it." Kate (not her real name) began investing in shares after her husband died. "My husband always managed the money. When he died there were all these decisions that I'd never taken that needed sorting. I carried on working and raising the children, and didn't really think about any investments other than to use the Isa allowance as it came up each year." The turning point for Kate was when she stopped work seven years ago. "I just couldn't do the job and raise the kids on my own." Suddenly she had more time on her hands and could do the research required to make sensible investment decisions. "I started off really small. Before, it was someone else always doing that investing and shouldering the risk, either in funds or in Isas, so when I started it suddenly seemed really risky to actually hit that 'buy' button. But I went in gently and read everything I could." Kate has researched her investments thoroughly. She began by reading around her subjects. That gave her the material she needed to home in on her specialism – oil. Kate was looking to invest in something she could hedge against and, for her, that was commodity shortages. Many oil companies may list on the London Stock Exchange and be bought in sterling by UK investors, but they are essentially a dollar-denominated asset, which can remove the sterling risk. "Once I found my forte, 90% of my active investing has been in oil shares. I'm not talking giants like BP, but small- and medium-sized companies. Their business is simpler to understand than, say, a bank or a pharmaceutical company, because they only have one product, so, as an investor, you're looking to find which company has an edge due to diligence." Kate has now returned to work – for one of Britain's leading charities – and says her investing takes as much time as she wants it to take. "I don't run shorts, derivatives or warrants and I don't do spread betting. I just run straight equity positions so I can switch off if I'm on a fortnight's holiday, for example. "I'm not glued to my PC, but I can do as much, or as little, as I choose." Cynthia, who does not want to give her full name, feels she has to do her own investing in order to get any returns, having seen her hard-earned investments reduce in value under the guidance of a broker. Having worked at the United Nationals Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) for 12 years, Cynthia took its "golden handshake" payment, worth around €50,000 (£41,500), and moved to the International Atomic Agency. She left the UN altogether in 2003 and moved to Britain with her husband. As UNIDO was based in Vienna, Cynthia entrusted her €50,000 to an Austrian broker. Seven years later, her investment is now worth just €40,000 (£33,200). "It's really hard to see my money lose so much value, but I feel stuck with it now. If I take that money out, then I've made the loss real. I'd rather keep the €40,000 where it is in Austria and hope it can make up its shortfall. I feel like I really have no control over that money. Having spent most of her working life outside the UK, Cynthia's investing strategy is strictly global. Her focus is on Brazil, China and emerging markets. "When I was with UNIDO I travelled a lot through Asia and Brazil, so I know where the opportunities are. For example, Brazil will be hosting the Olympics in 2016, so I'm looking at small- and medium-sized construction companies that I know will benefit from that work. "I'm also looking in Asia. I'm looking long term at construction, engineering and technology. My mum is from the Philippines, and I've travelled a lot to Asia for work, and this is an area I feel I know. I'm comfortable researching the data and the companies here, and I will have so much more control over my investment choices by buying and selling my own shares than I would if I chose another broker." However, Cynthia (above) is not ready to sever all advice ties. She has opted for an advisory online service rather than an "execution-only" one because she feels reassured that she can talk through her decisions. "I can do all my own research and come up with my choices, but then I can double-check, as well, before taking the plunge," she says. It won't all be high-risk, small-cap, emerging market companies. Cynthia has also homed in on a couple of blue chip favourites, "to get a bit more security, for the dividends, and to balance the portfolio".

FTSE finishes higher for fifth day but Inmarsat falls out of favour The fall came as Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation from neutral to underperform with a 725p price target, saying it believed the company may have to spend huge amounts of cash to replace its older satellites. The bank said: We are concerned by a number of operational issues, though our primary concern is that Inmarsat could announce a large fleet expansion in order drive top line revenue and fight off competition from the Fixed Satellite Service operators. Instead of the long awaited "cashflow harvest" investors had been expecting, shareholders could be hit for up to $1bn to fund new Ka-band satellites. We believe management could use the new long-term revenue guidance due at the second quarter on August 6 to unveil the unpleasant capex news. Based on data in its IPO prospectus, we believe Inmarsat now needs to announce a large fleet renewal as the age of its older generation satellites mean it will need further back-up capacity soon. Of Inmarsat's 11 satellites, four are beyond their original estimated useful lives, three others are due to end in the next two years and one in 2014. We believe Inmarsat is likely to announce a replacement fleet, probably using 3 or 4 new Ka-band satellites at a price of at least $250m each. The company meanwhile maintained Ka-band is only one option, and although expensive, would produce higher revenues. A decision would be made later this year, it said, adding that its performance so far this year had been solid, and it was likely to hit growth expectations. Meanwhile investors are still awaiting news of any possible bid for Inmarsat from its major shareholder Harbinger Capital Partners. BP closed 13.45p lower at 342p, as Fitch downgraded the company in the wake of the escalating costs of the Gulf of Mexico disaster and signs that its rivals had distanced themselves from the company at US Congressional hearings. We remain equal weight on Intercontinental as the outlook is uncertain, although we want to turn more positive as stronger-than-expected recent hotel demand suggests this should be a 'normal' hotel cycle, and we upgrade our 2010 revenue per available room estimate from -2% to +5%. The shares have been ticking lower over recent weeks, reflecting the absence of any positive news flow. That said, we anticipate investors will be severely disappointed in today's news. With the recent trading update indicating a pre-election and volcanic ash driven slowdown we would anticipate investors may discount further trading uncertainty. Bulls of the stock will point to the strong growth delivered in recent years. However, we are entering an unprecedented period of austerity and the company has aggressively been squeezing margins higher. We see significant potential pressure on margins over the short to medium term. We therefore re-iterate our sell recommendation and 170p price target.

IG Group shares hit all time high after positive update The company said it expected to report a rise in profits from £125.9m to £157m for the year ending May 31, with revenues up 16% to £298m. The final quarter in particular did well, with revenues up 24%. It said: [IG] has benefited from an increase in volatility in both forex and equity markets in the last few weeks of the year. This volatility boosted client activity and hence revenue, and also increased the rate of new account opening. It remains difficult to predict future trends in volatility or customer reaction to changing market and economic conditions. Strong account opening and the continued development of the offering leave the group well positioned for further growth. The company's shares have climbed 49.3p to 441.5p - up £12.5% - and analyst Robin Savage at Collins Stewart issued a buy note and said: [The profit number] is 3% above the top end of market expectations (£53m to £126m) and 8% above our forecast. Revenues of £298m will have surprised most of the market who were expecting between £294m and £257m, despite a very clear third quarter IMS in March which showed strong growth. We take this opportunity to increase our 2010 dividend expectation by 11% from 11.7p to 12.9p. The dividend could be even higher: dividend cover of 1.5 times would suggest a total dividend of 20p. This pre-close statement is likely to push IG Group shares to above the all time high of 430p. The final results on 20 July should reveal very strong cash flows and dividend paying capability. We reiterate our 500p target price.

Phoenix's £200m restructuring deal paves way for full stock market listing Britain's largest "zombie" insurance fund manager, which buys up insurance funds that have been closed to new business, wants to move from a secondary listing to a premium listing to raise its profile and boost its share price. It is also keen to go on a buying spree next year, which will further cut the cost of managing the insurance policies. "In due course, we believe that we will be able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the consolidation of the closed life sector, thereby enhancing value for our shareholders," said chief executive Jonathan Moss. The company, the brainchild of pizza and pub entrepreneur Hugh Osmond, has reached a deal to remove contingent share rights that, if approved by investors, will clear the way for the group to obtain a premium listing on 5 July. It expects to be included in the FTSE's UK indices from September. Phoenix announced today that it had agreed to buy out the contingent rights held by two of its main shareholders, by swapping nine shares for every 10 contingent rights. These entitlements promised shares in the business if the share price hit a certain level. They were issued to private equity investors Osmond and Manjit Dale's buyout firm TDR Capital to compensate them for giving up 70% of their stakes in the group as part of a restructuring a year ago, when the firm was in financial trouble and was acquired by an Amsterdam-listed vehicle. At today's London share price of 632.5p, up 7p, the new shares are worth about £200m and Phoenix is set to have a market value of £1bn following the capital restructuring, up from the current £840m. Phoenix hopes the premium listing will bring improved liquidity, wider analyst coverage and ultimately a re-rating of the share price, which it believes is undervalued The group has 6.5 million policyholders and £69bn of assets under management. "If we get this re-rating it will become much easier to think about acquisitions," said a spokesman. Analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove welcomed today's deal. "If passed by shareholders, it will leave a stock with a much simplified capital structure, delivering very strong cash flow." They said the likely impact is "significant share price upside potential, due to a lower share count; and over the medium term, improved liquidity in the shares and, hopefully, a consequent re-rating".

Former Vivendi boss Messier admits making 'mistakes' as he faces fraud trial In an uncharacteristic display of contrition, the man who was dubbed "master of the universe" by the French media for his arrogance and jet-setting lifestyle, told a panel of judges he recognised that his track record as chief executive of the group until 2002 was not perfect. "Did we make strategic errors? Yes, undoubtedly. I take responsibility for them," said Messier, who embarked on a string of acquisitions to transform an ageing French water company into a multibillion-pound group. "Certain decisions which I took, which we took collectively, turned out not to have been the best. I certainly made mistakes," he told the court. He denies all the charges, which cover a two-year period from 2000, the year of Vivendi's $34bn (£23bn) acquisition of Seagram, the Canadian entertainment and music company. If found guilty, Messier faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €350,000 (£292,400). In the latest chapter of the legal saga surrounding the near-implosion of Vivendi, the former Lazard banker is standing trial along with six other executives, including Edgar Bronfman Jr, former vice-chairman, who are accused of criminal activity while at Vivendi. All deny the charges. Unlike a class action suit brought to trial in New York earlier this year, which cleared Messier of wrongdoing but found Vivendi itself liable of misleading investors, the media and telecommunications firm does not figure among the accused in the French trial. In fact it is one of the plaintiffs, together with a group of French investors whose original complaint in 2002 sparked the criminal inquiry into the period the media now refer to as "les années Messier". The Paris court will now have to rule on whether, through his alleged involvement in a move to buy back nearly €2bn of Vivendi stock after 11 September 2001, Messier was manipulating the share price. It will also have to decide whether what Messier today described as his "excessive communication" about the robust state of Vivendi's financial affairs constituted misleading investors. His much-derided "golden parachute" of 2002 – which included €18.6m severance pay which he subsequently forfeited, and a chauffeur for his wife – is also up for discussion. D'Huy has said the destruction Messier left in his wake at Vivendi – including debts of up to €27bn – was such that the deal was "clearly excessive". Today, at the start of the month-long trial, the business chief insisted he had acted in the "interest" of the company and claimed many of the assets bought under his stewardship were now proving some of Vivendi's most profitable.He had, he said, learned one thing throughout the inquiries, which, aside from the two criminal trials, led to him being fined in 2003 and 2004 by French and US financial market regulators. "You can be proud without being arrogant," he told the court. "At the time, I gave the impression of arrogance, not of pride."--ends--

World markets shaky as European debt fears remain Japan's stock market today hit its lowest closing level in more than five months amid ongoing worries over the global implications of the European debt crisis. Japan's benchmark Nikkei index shed 26.14 points, or 0.3%, to 9,758.40, its lowest close since early December, after earlier falling as low as 9,693.07. Japanese exporters were hit, on fears that they could suffer if Europe's economic recovery is derailed. Most Japanese bank shares rose, though, following their US peers higher as a major regulatory overhaul of Wall Street firms turned out to be less onerous than many had feared. Other Asian stock markets rose today, led by China, with investors taking heart from the late rally on Wall Street on Friday. China's Shanghai Composite index rose 3.1% to 2,664.65, South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.6% to 1,610.44 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.6% to 19,657.88.

Pension deficits threaten 1 in 10 FTSE firms Almost one in ten blue-chip FTSE-100 companies face pension scheme deficits so vast they threaten the future of the business, a survey has discovered. The report says that only five FTSE-100 pension funds are in surplus, and predicts that final salary pension schemes at top companies could end within three years. The survey by Pension Capital Strategies in association with investment bank group JP Morgan Cazenove says nine of Britain's biggest listed companies face pension liabilities greater than their stock market value – a situation which PCS says "represents a material risk to the business". The survey also reveals that pension funds missed out on the benefit of soaring equity markets in the year to the end of March, because they have continued to switch their investments into bonds. Three years ago the average pension scheme allocated 34% to bonds, but this has now risen to 50%. PCS says that with cash in short supply it expects pension trustees to be increasingly open to approaches to deficit funding. Instead of cash, they could be persuaded to take other assets. Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer, for instance, have recently announced property partnership deals with their schemes worth a total of more than £1bn towards reducing their deficits. While deficit funding is up, there has been a marked decline in the provision of defined benefit pensions to staff. The costs linked to continuing provision fell 15% last year – "one of the clearest signs yet that we are coming to the end of the road for final salary schemes", said Charles Cowling, managing director of PCS. He predicted that final salary schemes could be extinct in big companies by 2013: "If reductions continue at this rate, final salary schemes will have six years left of life; if the trend accelerates, which is likely given recent announcements of pension scheme closures, then the lifespan of the final salary scheme may be as little as two to three years." The costs of running final salary schemes have risen dramatically in recent years as a result of tax changes, low interest rates, poor investment returns and increasing life expectancy. The five companies with the best funded schemes, and which still have surpluses, are Old Mutual, Prudential, Investec, Land Securities and the London Stock Exchange

FTSE falls 3% on German shorting ban, while Home Retail struggles On another volatile day for the stock market thanks to Germany's surprise ban on short selling European debt, one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 was suffering because of more domestic concerns. The stock has been supported recently by share buybacks and M&A hopes. While acquiring Argos would fulfil the ambitions of certain food retailers, we note that a competition commission reference would be almost certain, separating Argos and Homebase may be costly, and that two of the big four UK grocers have new CEOs. On trading, Hughes added: Earnings risks are rising, with the new government possibly tightening fiscal policy more rapidly than expected. VAT may rise sooner, and sterling has continued to decline versus the dollar. The first quarter may start off slowly with more competition in electricals, and cooler weather affecting Homebase. Best Buy may only have one store but its website pricing in the autumn is likely to be very aggressive. We estimate Argos a 5% fall in first quarter like for like sales. For the full year we now assume a 2% like for like fall from a 1% decline as second half catch-up may be harder. This gives a £10m downgrade. Homebase is still based on +1% full year like for like sales, with broadly flat earnings befolre interest and tax. In such a febrile market rumours were rife, including unsubstantiated talk that the European Central Bank was ready to intervene to support the euro and even speculation - immediately denied - that Greece was about to leave the single currency. Among the UK banks, we are wary of Barclays. It has meaningful retail and corporate operations in Spain (although it is unknown what exact proportion of the group this comprises) and an undisclosed ownership of Spanish sovereign debt. The company will likely make acquisitions during the year and the bid pipeline is stronger than at the beginning of the calendar year. But the company will continue to pay out excess cash to shareholders going forward - so this buyback scheme could be ongoing. In a buy note on Experian UBS said: We still find the valuation attractive relative to slower growing peer Equifax, historical valuation levels, our fundamental discounted cash flow valuation, and given what is now a more compelling cash return story. We continue to view improvement in core US credit operations as a key fundamental driver over the coming 12 months. At the time of the IPO [in 2007], Blinkx talked about the potential to launch transaction hijacking software. This is software that recognizes when users are about to buy something online and, before a sale is completed, displays options for purchasing the same good from rival retailers at a cheaper price. This software, branded 'cheep', is currently in closed beta and should be released to the public in the the second half of 2010. This presents a potential opportunity for Blinkx to enter the very dynamic affiliate marketing/price comparison market. Some traders believe the company would be an attractive target for a larger group such as Google.

Jupiter Asset Management plans stock market float that could raise £300m Jupiter Asset Management, one of Britain's biggest retail investment fund groups, has announced plans to return to the stock market in a move that could generate more than £300m in cash windfall payments for private equity backers, star fund managers and company directors, led by chief executive Edward Bonham Carter. Despite weeks of market volatility, Jupiter's management and US buyout house TA Associates are pressing ahead with flotation plans that could value the business at up to £1bn. The move follows a string of aborted or stalled new issues, including New Look, Merlin Entertainments and hotel bookings firm Travelport. Share sales and the issue of new shares would see management reduce its equity share holdings from 80% to about 50%. New investors are expected to take up a free float of about 30% with TA acquiring shares to keep its holding steady at 20% for the first six months. The majority of the £220m proceeds from the issue of new shares will go to repay shareholder-owned debt. About 80% of these preference securities are held by TA, with the balance controlled by a small number of senior figures at Jupiter. Top fund managers such as Tony Nutt and Philip Gibbs as well as directors have agreed to a three-year phased lock-in and vesting period for before further share sales. The capital-raising is not expected significantly to reduce the group's net bank debt which management believe is already at a comfortable level given Jupiter's high cash generation. Net debt at float is expected to be about £150m. Float plans come three years after Bonham Carter led a buyout from Commerzbank in the summer of 2007, just weeks before the credit crunch brought an abrupt end to large debt-fuelled private equity deals. It was one of the last buyout transactions to secure so-called "covenant-lite" terms. Jupiter, meanwhile, has weathered the credit crunch rather better despite having a strong focus on the British stock market. It has even lured back some fund managers who had gone to New Star. Gibbs became a hero for many investors after his Financial Opportunities fund returned 7% in 2008. Identifying trouble ahead for the banks, in November 2007 he placed half the fund in cash and bonds and invested heavily outside Britain, benefiting from the weakening pound.

Glencore considers flotation on London stock market to raise £4bn   Glencore, the world's biggest commodities trader, is to raise up to €5bn (£4.2bn) in one of the biggest flotations on the London stock market, according to City sources. Analysts value the company at €45bn. Proceeds from a flotation will be used to expand the mining side of Glencore's business, with the Swiss-based company looking at acquisitions in Brazil, Australia and South Africa. Glencore took the first step towards becoming a public company recently by issuing up to $2.2bn (£1.5bn) in convertible bonds to strategic investors in the US, Singapore and China. "The mix of investors is typical of what you would expect in a pre-initial public offering", a commodities banker said. Glencore said that the bonds were convertible "into Glencore shares upon a qualifying IPO or upon other pre-determined qualifying events". A flotation is pencilled in for 2011, but could come earlier if the economic recovery gathers steam and prices continue their upward trajectory. Glencore's increasing openness further moves it away from its roots under Marc Rich, the oil trader who founded Glencore in 1974 but later sold out to management. In 1983, Rudolph Giuliani, then a US prosecutor, indicted Rich for tax evasion and he became a fugitive in Switzerland. On leaving office in 2001, President Bill Clinton pardoned Rich. Some observers suggest preparation for a flotation is the precursor to a merger with Xstrata [see footnote], which could create a natural resources group valued at more than $50bn. Sources say that the merger option is the preferred route for Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's chief executive, and there have been reports that executives have met Xstrata shareholders. A merger of Glencore and Xstrata is being seen as the best way for Glencore to go public, because the companies are connected. Glencore owns a significant number of Xstrata shares. Willy Strothotte is chairman of both companies. And Glencore was instrumental in creating Xstrata: in 2001 it sold coal assets to the then-fledgling mining company and those assets became Xstrata's bedrock for its 2002 flotation. "Glasenberg would love to have all the mining assets and the trading assets combined under one roof," said an executive familiar with Glencore's thinking. Xstrata boss Mick Davis could be receptive. He built his company through a string of acquisitions, but his boldest bid – to merge Xstrata with Anglo American – failed last year. In a recent speech Davis reiterated Xstrata's "commitment to scale and diversity as key sources of advantage in an increasingly globalising and consolidating mining industry." But agreeing a valuation of Glencore with Xstrata investors could prove tricky and may force Glencore to float first before considering anything else. An extra benefit of such a move, say observers, would be that it would force the trader to adapt to an independent board and other aspects of public corporate governance. This could lessen the culture shock of merging with a FTSE 100 company. Glencore is seeking a flotation because, as a private company led by a partnership, its growth options are few. Relying on the bond markets limits its ability to make big acquisitions. If it could raise equity on the stock market, the company could expand more rapidly and take much bigger strides along the way. It is thought that Glencore is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, while Xstrata has retained Goldman Sachs [see footnote].

Stock market turmoil: City reaction On the UK election … He told Sky News: "What everyone wants is boring predictable stability. If in a week's time there is still a squabble then I repeat, the markets will punish us with higher interest rates." Clarke said that a downgrading of the UK's credit rating was likely as a result of no party winning an overally majority. "Ahead of the election we saw the risk of downgrade at close to 50% - far higher than the Reuters consensus of 10%. On the basis of the election outcome as it looks now, a downgrade looks to be the most likely outcome." "The markets are in a nervous mood for lots of reasons. Any sort of constitutional stand-off or uncertainty sends out the wrong signal not just to domestic investors but international domestics who will be very puzzled by what's going on." "If there is a coalition, I would like to see them come up with a spending review as quickly as possible and the Conservatives – or the other party in the coalition – back it up. These three parties have got to see that this is a big crisis, there could be a sterling crisis, a gilts crisis. Markets have been extraordinarily complacent about the prospect of a hung parliament. Moody's recently said it may be a good thing if there was a coalition. I was staggered by that." He said that if the Conservatives formed a minority government, they may be reluctant to cut the deficit too quickly for fear of being challenged to another election which they may lose. "Fiscal tightening on the scale needed to get back to fiscal sustainability may well not be politcially sustainable with aw minority government." "You probably couldn't get a worse result for the market with no party gaining a mandate to form a government and the most likely coalition combination, Labour and the Lib Dems, not having enough seats between them to form a majority government." "The worst thing for markets would be a coalition government failing in a few months and a new election being called. This would intensify the pressure on ratings agencies to downgrade the UK's sovereign rating from AAA and make fiscal consolidation even more difficult." "The longer any political discussions [over forming a coalition] drag on for, the more nervous financial markets can expect to become, standing to weaken further both sterling and UK equities." Parker told Bloomberg television that the Liberal Democrats' expected insistence on electoral form in return for forming a possible coalition with Labour "could be a negative for the market" as "markets want focus on how to address the budget deficit [first]". Lewis told Bloomberg: "This is going to be a normal correction – we are in a sideways volatile era you get after a deep recession. It's too soon to call and end to the recovery in the economy or stock markets." Lannoo told Bloomberg in Brussels that policymakers and politicians did not understand the markets' reaction to Greece's financial crisis. "They lack understanding. They can't just say the markets are speculators. They can only react on a signal and they don't have one [right now]. They have to listen to them because the next bubble will be government debt." He said that he did not expect today's emergency eurozone summit to result in a wideranging enough response to shore up markets and prevent contagion to weaker European economies like Spain and Portugal.

General election 2010: Can Dow Jones index predict UK election winner? As Britain finally goes to the polls, one of the more esoteric indicators of who might lead the next government – the US stock market – is predicting a win for the Conservative party. But the weakness in equity markets this week has seen the Dow swing from supporting Labour to backing a Conservative victory. The Dow started last week at 11205 – its highest point since the election was called and well above its 10969 close on 6 April. But last night the Dow closed down at 10868. As the oldest stock market index for which data is readily available, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, established in 1896, provides an intriguing and consistent indicator of UK election results. The only setbacks to the Dow's otherwise unblemished record came in the elections of 1987 and 2005. However, in both those elections the prime ministers who won the voters' support did not see out their full term. Margaret Thatcher won the 1987 election but was subsequently replaced by John Major. Tony Blair won the 2005 election but later gave way to Gordon Brown. What makes the Dow's consistency more compelling is that there are no obvious market factors which influence its performance and the data spans times of war, recession, crises and disasters and bull and bear markets. Nor is there any correlation between the rate of growth in the Dow and the UK election. It took the Dow 28 years to double to 500, 16 to double to 1,000, 15 to double to 2,000, 8 years to reach 4,000 and 2 years to double to 8,000 in 1997. Since 1997, the year the current Labour Party came to power, the Dow breached 14,000 in 2007 but has still, after 13 years, not doubled up on the 8,000 level. The performance of the Dow over the course of an election campaign may regularly predict the winning party but gives no insight into that party's majority, or indeed whether it has one. A big movement does not mean a big majority. When Stanley Baldwin led the Conservatives to power in 1924 with a massive 210-seat majority, the Dow Jones had fallen by just one point in predicting his victory. However, ahead of the last hung parliament in 1974, the movement on the Dow was just 5 points representing a rise of less than 1%. Based on the 6 April 2010 close, a 1% movement on the Dow would be 106 points. Last night the Dow closed 101 points below its level at the start of the election campaign. The Dow is therefore in hung parliament territory and while it and the FTSE 100 are pointing to the Conservatives as the winning party, the Dow is also fulfilling conditions which could point to a strong showing for the Liberal Democrats. The FTSE 100 closed at 5780.4 on 6, April and at yesterday's close at 5341.9 is still well down on the campaign opening level and thus favouring David Cameron. The Liberal Democrats must go back to the early 20th Century to find any comfort from the Dow's performance. The last time the Liberal party, as it then was, formed a government after an election held on a day when the US market was open was in January 1911. The key for the Liberal Democrats was that the victory came on a day when, for the second election in succession, the Dow closed at a level still below its previous closing high for that century achieved on a UK election day. The Dow's 20th century election day peak was achieved on 13 February 1906 when it closed at 100. The Dow closed at 89 on the day of the following election and at 85 when the Liberals formed a government in 1911. The 21st century peak for the Dow on a UK election day came in June 2001 when it closed at 11090. At the last election in 2005 the Dow closed at 10340. With the Dow below that 11090 election day peak last night, the Liberal Democrats will be hoping history repeats itself.

Greek rescue fears hit global stock markets Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was forced to deny market rumours his country would ask for €280bn from the European Union, something he described as "complete madness". But Spain's stock market has lost nearly 5% today, while Germany's DAX is down more than 2% and France's CAC is around 3% lower. Portugal's PSI 20 is also down around 4%, while the cost of protecting the debt of a number of European countries has also jumped. The New York Stock Exchange was more than 200 points lower in early trading, while the FTSE 100 closed down more than 2.5% or 142 points at 5411. The euro has tumbled to a one-year low against the dollar, down 1% to $1.3048. Banking shares are among the major fallers, on concerns about their exposure to Greece and the other European countries. Miners are also under pressure after a new Australian tax was proposed over the weekend which could knock their earnings and delay development projects. Sterling-priced bullion hit a high of £783.33 an ounce and gold also set records in euros and Swiss francs. Spot gold in dollars hit $1,188.86 an ounce, the highest since early December. German economy minister Rainer Brüderle added to the uncertainty by telling Reuters that the €110bn package was not intended to cover Greece's entire financial requirements for the next three years. Instead, Brüderle suggested, Greece will need to return to the financial markets in perhaps 18 months to satisfy its borrowing needs. Brüderle's warning helped to knock the Greek banking sector down by almost 6% today in Athens, where public sector workers began a two-day strike in protest at the austerity measures demanded by the International Monetary Fund. The cost of insuring Greek debt from default rose, wiping out some of Monday's falls. Spanish and Portuguese credit default swaps were also up, showing there was still concern that the crisis would spread from Athens to the eurozone's weaker members. Germany continued to take a tough line against Greece, having finally agreed to contribute €22bn to the rescue effort. Finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said that Greece would be plunged into insolvency if it failed to meet its promises to raise taxes across the economy, increase the retirement age to 65, and cut the size of its public sector. "If there are any violations, payments will be stopped. Then Athens will once again be threatened with bankruptcy," Schäuble told the Rheinische Post newspaper. Shortly before midday, the credit default swap on Greek five-year bonds rose to 674 basis points (bps), from 646.5 in New York trading last night. Spanish five-year credit default swaps rose to 166.4bps, from 157.7bps while their Portuguese equivalent rose to 281.8bps from 275.3bps. The gap between the yield on German 10-year bonds and their Portuguese and Spanish equivalents also rose. Lazards, the investment bank with a long history of debt restructuring deals, said that it has been hired to advise the Greek government on general financial matters.

Reckitt disappoints as FTSE falls 2.6% on Greek junk rating As leading shares suffered their biggest one day fall since November on sovereign debt worries, the consumer goods company behind the likes of Cillit Bang and Vanish was a major faller after its results disappointed investors. At first glance a 15% increase in first quarter operating profit to £348m looked impressive, with a strong start to the year and delays to generic competition to its Suboxone heroin substitute. On top of that it revealed an Office of Fair Trading enquiry into alleged anti-competitive behaviour concerning its gaviscon heartburn treatment, for which it plans to make a provision. In theory the OFT could fine Reckitt up to 10% of its £8bn total turnover, if it rules against the company. Analysts James Edwardes Jones and Martin Dolan at Execution Noble said: We are not blown away by either the quantity or quality of these results and remain holders. This will not go down as a vintage set of results by Reckitt's standards. In large part this is a function of the height to which they have raised the bar when it comes to reporting. But it has to be said that underlying revenue growth of 5% is at the lower end of consumer companies that have reported so far and is unusually no better than Reckitt's guidance. And while net income of £348m exceeded consensus expectations of £341m it was some way short of the most optimistic estimates, including our own £366m.

Cuts jeopardise solar utility IPO A plan to set up an innovative "green" utility with a £1bn flotation on the London stock market risks being blown off course due to financial problems in the eurozone. An Engyco spokesman said €3bn of potential investment was at stake if Madrid introduced plans to reduce solar subsidies, which he believed would only save ministers €420m. City analysts specialising in the clean-technology sector believe there is little chance of Engyco being launched in the next couple of weeks as scheduled given the negative noises coming out of Madrid. "This is nothing less than a catastrophe" for investors, said Stephane Aderca, an energy analyst at Liberum Capital in London. "We had believed that a promise [to pay a certain level of subsidy] is a promise. Going back on a promise brings the whole thing into question." Spain's government has sucked in an estimated €18bn in solar-power projects since 2008 by offering generous public subsidies but is now looking at cutting back as the economy suffers. The state has the authority to cut prices paid to operating renewable power plants under a 2007 law, according to an industry ministry spokesman who declined to be identified. All options are being assessed for a new strategic plan this year, he told local media, in comments that led some Spanish solar and wind developer shares to fall over 4% at the end of last week.
