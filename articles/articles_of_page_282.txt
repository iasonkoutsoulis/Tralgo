Stock markets rally after G20 accord Stock markets rallied this morning after finance ministers from the G20 nations vowed to avert a currency war that could derail the global economic recovery. The FTSE 100 in London climbed nearly 50 points to 5790.34 in early trading, a gain of 0.8% while Germany's Dax was up 40 points at 6646.39 and France's CAC rose about 14 points to 3882.71. At their weekend meeting in South Korea G20 finance ministers agreed to refrain from devaluing their currencies to gain competitive advantage, although they failed to adopt concrete targets to address trade imbalances. As a result, the trend of selling the dollar continued - the greenback hit a 15-year low against the yen, falling 1% to ¥80.52. The euro shot above the $1.40 mark and the pound also strengthened, rising to $1.5764 from $1.5669. Some analysts played down the importance of the G20 and said the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve will pump more money into the economy next week was more significant. "The G20 was seen as a hurdle by some and now that is over, investors are back to what they are most comfortable with - dollar selling," said Anita Dudani, G10 currency strategist at RBS.

Singapore bourse makes $8.3bn offer for Australian stock exchange The combined exchange company would be the world's fifth-largest by market value and rank as the second-largest stock market in Asia by number of listed companies, the two exchanges said in a joint statement. But by other measures it would still rank behind Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. The deal aims to give both exchanges a better chance of prospering amid increased competition within Asia and as cross-border trading platforms like Chi-X Europe usurp the dominance of established stock exchanges. The Australian Securities Exchange, known as ASX, is set to lose its monopoly on operating a stock market in Australia in 2011 and an affiliate of Chi-X Europe is planning to set up a trading system once the monopoly is abolished. Singapore, meanwhile, has long lagged behind Hong Kong and Tokyo as a regional financial centre. "The capital flow we see today is really changing from west to east," said Singapore Exchange chief executive Magnus Bocker at a news conference. "This will be the gateway to Asian capital markets." The exchange operating company formed from the takeover of ASX would have a market value of $12.3bn and be responsible for some 2,700 listed companies. According to September data from the World Federation of Exchanges, the combined exchange would list companies worth about $1.9tn, the fourth most in Asia behind Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange have a total market capitalisation of $12.3tn, the most in the world. Combined trading volume of the Singaporean and Australian exchanges was worth about $1tn during the first nine months of the year, the sixth most in Asia and far behind global leader NYSE which has had volume worth $13.8tn in the January-to-September period. ASX shares surged more than 20% when trading resumed after the announcement to AU$43.49. Shares in Singapore Exchange, also known as SGX, fell 5.3% to 9.04 Singapore dollars (£4.41). The companies hope to finalise the deal in the second quarter of 2011, but will need the approval of regulators in each country including Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan. "I don't think we would have announced it if we didn't believe that the approvals would be forthcoming," ASX chief executive Robert Elstone said. The chief of Australia's competition regulator said he did not see any potential problems with the proposed deal. "I think it's a matter between the Singapore Exchange and the Australian exchange, and I can't see that raising competition issues for us," Graeme Samuel, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. "Of course we're much more focused on the potential for new competitors to enter into the Australian market in terms of stock exchange dealings," he said.

Social networks offer free access to the beating pulse of the nation It's taken a while for the penny to drop, but finally the world is waking up to the fact that the phenomenon of social networking might actually tell us useful things about what's happening out there in the world beyond the Washington Beltway and the Westminster village. Not only that, but the resulting data might even be useful for predicting what's likely to happen. Bollen and his colleagues set out to investigate whether public sentiment, as expressed in large-scale collections of daily Twitter posts, can be used to predict the stock market. They used a standard psychological tool to measure mood along six dimensions – calmness, alertness, sureness, vitality, kindness and happiness – and then analysed nearly 10m tweets posted by 2.7 million users between 28 February and 19 December 2008 to extract indicators of mood implicit in tweets. They then looked for evidence of correlation between different kinds of mood and movements in the Dow Jones industrial average. They concluded that the predictive accuracy of standard stock-market prediction models was significantly improved when certain mood dimensions were included (for example "calm" and "happiness" as one measure of mood), but not others – "general happiness" being one example. Once upon a time, this kind of research would have attracted only the derisive snorting of technophobes. Why should we take seriously the 140-character vapourings of geeks and media types? What we really need to know is what "ordinary" or "normal" people think. The problem with that kind of technophobic scepticism is that cyberspace is increasingly coming to look like the "real" world. The demographic characteristics of Twitter's 200 million users (or of Facebook's 500 million) are undoubtedly still a bit skewed compared with those of the population as a whole, but over time that will change: these social networks will increasingly be made up of folks like you and me. In which case, the communications that go on between their members will become the best guide we have to the zeitgeist. If Ed Miliband wants to have a finger on the pulse of the nation, then the smartest thing he could do would be to hire a few geeks and set them to work.

Oil and gold recover after China's rate rise "It seems to me there was a very knee-jerk reaction to the China move across all commodities, and now people are starting to step back and think about what it actually means for Chinese growth," said Yingxi Yu, commodities analyst at Barclays Capital in Singapore. "The answer is probably not much. The actual impact of this rate hike might be limited on the overall growth story in China." Yesterday's rally in the dollar proved short-lived. It slipped 0.2% against a basket of major currencies today following yesterday's gain of more than 1.6%. China's key stock index closed 0.07% higher after a volatile session. The Shanghai Composite Index finished the day at 3,003.95 points, after falling nearly 2% earlier on. By contrast, most other Asian markets closed lower although they pared earlier losses. Japan's Nikkei index fell 1.7%, to 9,381.60, its lowest close in two weeks. Australia's benchmark index was off 0.7% at 4,623.5 while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slid 0.9% to 23,543.59. Analysts said traders were using the interest rate hike as an excuse for profit-taking.

China's interest rate rise sends global markets into turmoil China sent financial markets into turmoil after it increased its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points with effect from tomorrow. The move to raise rates by a quarter percentage point was flagged by the Chinese authorities as an internal signal to property developers that rampant house price inflation was intolerable and would be controlled by the Beijing government. However, the rise was seen more widely as appeasing US policymakers, who have called for China to increase the value of its currency. The IMF warned earlier this month that the world economy was threatened by attempts to artificially depress currency values. China has long been accused by the US administration of maintaining low interest rates to keep the value of its currency low and exports cheap. The pound reacted by falling more than two cents against the dollar in mid-afternoon trading, while the euro was 1% lower on the day at $1.3805 Stock markets reacted badly to the news with Germany's Dax down 41.10 points, or 0.6%, at 6475.53, while the CAC-40 in France was 20.99 points, or 0.6%, lower at 3813.51. The FTSE-100 index of leading British shares was down at 5,711, a drop of more than 30 points. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 146.18 points at 10,997.51. Hitendra Dave, head of global markets at HSBC India, said internal pressures led to the rise. "China hasn't raised so far and [they] have only been raising the reserve requirements. With all the asset price speculation, they had to raise rates to normalise policy. It is the local factors that led them to take this decision." Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange at the Dutch bank ING, said: "This is part of the moderate tightening cycle that we are seeing from Chinese authorities to balance their economy. It is part of the normalisation of interest rates in an economy which is growing at a modestly fast clip. "The market is reacting like there is an increased risk of hard landing with the commodity currencies like the Aussie being sold off, but I don't think that is the case," he said. Simon Derrick, of Bank of New York Mellon, said the move was fuelling speculation that Beijing was involved in backdoor deals with the US administration to nudge its currency upwards. "The move follows a clear need by the Chinese authorities to take out some of the heat from the economy. Whether this will lead to a broader move on its currency is open to debate. It certainly leads to speculation that the US and China are in some sort of a deal which will perhaps see the US taking a more gradualist approach to quantitative easing. The dollar has already moved higher after this news," he said.

Thomson Reuters columnist resigns over failure to disclose share ownership The Reuters code of conduct forbids journalists from writing about shares they own unless they notify their interest to their manager and from dealing in shares about which they have written recently or intend to write in the near future. David Schlesinger, Reuters' editor-in-chief, told staff in an internal note today that several other cases had come to light as a result of questioning Reuters Breakingviews staff where disclosures to readers or managers could or should have been made. "While we have no evidence the journalist was abusing his position for financial gain, we take such breaches extremely seriously and that journalist resigned with immediate effect during our investigation," said Schlesinger. He added that Collins wrote commentary about companies in which he had a financial interest and made trades shortly afterwards. The investigation is continuing, Scheslinger added. Reuters said it had added these disclaimers to a total of 53 online columns by the three journalists dating back to February 2009 – the majority written by Collins. The disclaimer has been added to all relevant archived columns to say whether the commentators held shares in the companies at the time and if they traded them shortly before or after publication. A total of 36 of the columns were published in 2009, while 17 were published this year. From March 2009, Collins commentated on the financial affairs of 15 companies in which he owned shares. It is not clear for how long Collins owned shares in the companies mentioned before they were published. The most recent column, published on 29 September and written by Collins, is on the BP executive board reshuffle after the Gulf oil disaster. Shares in the company reached a three-month high in the days following the news. Unmack owned shares in Lloyds TSB contingent convertible bonds – dubbed "CoCos" – from mid-December 2009 up until mid-July this year and during that period he wrote about the company seven times. Doyle owned shares in RBS and the Bank of Ireland when writing about the companies. Collins said in his email to Dixon, seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk, that he dealt shares "infrequently" and that he "saw an opportunity" in BP as the price fell in the aftermath of the Gulf oil spill. "I failed to connect my comments for Reuters – among millions of words written on BP at the time – with the purchases," Collins writes. "I had read Reuters' rules about share dealing on joining the company in March 2009, but my recollection was incorrect. I did recall the phrase 'The test is whether the editorial activity might continue to have an impact on the securities.' This is surely the point of the rules." He also admitted that he had sold a "substantial" stake in Marks & Spencer, obtained from his late father's estate, just five days after commenting on the company's financial results. "As with BP, I view this as a serious, but technical breach of the rules. At no stage do I consider that I have abused my position at Reuters," Collins said "On discovering the second breach, I felt I had no choice but to offer my resignation, which you accepted on 15 October... I am saddened and embarrassed by my breaches of the rules and hope that you will shortly be able to draw a line under this unfortunate episode." He went on to write a twice-weekly column for the London Evening Standard. Known for his acerbic style, he was named financial journalist of the year at the British Press Awards in 2002. He joined Thomson Reuters as a columnist in early 2009, moving to Breakingviews when the financial commentary website was bought by the news agency last year. Doyle is a former Daily Telegraph and Economist journalist, specialising in investment banking. Unmack writes about credit markets, hedge funds and Italy for Reuters Breakingviews and previously worked for Bloomberg News and Euromoney Institutional Investor. Thomson Reuters said it was reviewing procedures and training and had called on all Reuters staff to review their involvement in the financial markets to make sure they were complying with the code. It is not currently a standard requirement that Thomson Reuters columnists and news staff declare any relevant securities holdings at the foot of columns and stories, but this policy is now being reviewed.

Standard Chartered launches rights issue The bank, which specialises in emerging markets in Asia and Africa, said it would offer shareholders the right to buy one new share for every eight shares held at a price of 1,280p, a 32% discount to Tuesday's closing price in London. Fees for the cash call, including those paid to its underwriters JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and UBS, will amount to just over $100m. The bank also said it had made "very good progress" in the third quarter, with income rising faster than in the first half. Trade volumes were almost back to pre-crisis levels, it added. Gary Jenkins at Evolution Securities said: "If this becomes a trend and banks move ahead of the timetable set by Basel III is can only be a good thing for bondholders." Standard Chartered shares dropped 67p to £18.41 in early trading in London, a fall of nearly 3.6%.

FSA clampdown is a leakers' charter The FSA appears to want all media inquiries to be handled by press officers on recorded phone lines. That idea has no hope of preventing "strategic leaks" – those in which the leaker seeks an advantage by putting a few facts in the public domain (for example, an investment banker trying to bounce his wavering client into launching a takeover bid). Determined leakers will simply continue to bypass official channels in the knowledge that the FSA's police cannot be everywhere. There will be always be fat fees to be earned by doing deals and the mobile phone cannot be uninvented. But the FSA's diktat may influence behaviour in the day-to-day interactions between the press and the City. The FSA, in effect, has handed companies and their advisers a licence to refuse to talk on any matter that can be deemed remotely price-sensitive. Indeed, the process seems to be under way already. What will this achieve? Newspapers, whose appetite for scoops will never be dimmed, will be more inclined to publish stories without verifying facts. Companies will be less able to use common sense when talking to journalists. And the vacuum will be filled by the most artful leakers, whose whispered words will achieve greater rarity and thus greater power. The FSA should listen to the media's across-the-board condemnation of its proposals. Yes, of course we have an interest in encouraging sources to talk. But we also know when the FSA is being so heavy-handed that it risks making matters worse for itself and the market.

Firms leaving Alternative Investment Market soar by 25%, study shows   As many as 45 companies left AIM between July and September, up from 36 in the second quarter, according to research by Trowers & Hamlins, a City law firm, and accounting group UHY Hacker Young. Of those, 20 businesses left after being involved in a merger, the study said. Non M&A-related delistings remained stable at 25, following 24 in the first and second quarters. "The levelling out of delistings over the last three quarters, once M&A activity is factored out, suggests some companies are in fact being acquired before they are forced to delist because of financial stress," said Charles Wilson, partner at Trowers & Hamlins. AIM, which lists about 1,200 business with a combined market value of £58bn, is commonly used by entrepreneurs to either expand, or sell their business. The number of new entrants on the market rose to 16 in the third quarter, compared with just two in the second quarter last year, in the midst of the credit crunch. The figures are still far behind the 28 debutants in the second quarter of 2008, when equity investors – ignoring the deep crisis in credit markets – welcomed new issues. "As with the rest of the economy, AIM's recovery is proving not to be a sudden bounceback but more of a slow crawl," said Chris Lowry, a partner at UHY Hacker Young. "It could be some years before we see companies joining at the rate we saw pre-recession." The number of companies that abandoned the market due to financial stress or insolvency rose slightly to eight in the third quarter, but an improvement from the 27 business that left over the same period last year. "Whilst AIM's wounds are healing, the recession is clearly leaving scars that will take time to disappear," Wilson said.

Dairy Crest insists it's not for sale after Müller reveals stake Mark Allen, Dairy Crest's chief executive, said he planned to keep his company independent as he announced that strong sales of cheese had boosted the group's first-half sales in the face of a competitive milk market. Speaking after the company behind Müllerlight and Müller Corner disclosed a 3.04% stake in Dairy Crest, Allen said: "Müller hasn't made an approach and we are not soliciting approaches from anyone. We've got a very good business and think we are doing a pretty good job by ourselves. We are happy where we are." In a trading update, Dairy Crest said sales of its Cathedral City cheddar brand had shown "strong growth" in the first half. Furthermore, its four other biggest brands – Country Life butter, the Clover and St Hubert Omega 3 spreads and the Frijj milkshake – also recorded higher revenues this year than last, the company said. However, Allen cautioned that the market for milk is "presently" very competitive as supermarkets engage in a price war. Suppliers are bearing the brunt of these price reductions, which are eroding their profit margins. Earlier this week, Morrison extended Dairy Crest's milk supply contract until 2015, although neither party would say whether the supermarket was paying it less than under the previous arrangement. At the time, Robert Wiseman declined to comment on speculation that it had been forced to lower its prices to match those of a competitor in order to keep a contract with Tesco, Britain's biggest retail chain. The price war was kicked off by Asda when it started selling four-pint bottles for £1.25 – and two bottles for £2. This prompted Tesco to slash the price of a four-pint container from £1.43 to £1.25 earlier this month. Shares in Dairy Crest, which increased by 7% on Wednesday amid hopes that Müller might bid for the group, fell by 1.80p, to close at 370.80p today. Müller's spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment on any plans the company may have to raise its stake in Dairy Crest or bid for the company outright.

As cheap money fails to lift US home sales, Spain tries austerity   Sales of new homes in the US remained on the floor last month, the second lowest level in almost 40 years, sending a signal to Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernake that historically low interest rates had failed to bolster confidence in the housing market. With thousands of unsold or repossessed homes across the US and near 10% unemployment, analysts warned that any plans by the Fed to flood the economy with cheap money in another round of quantitative easing would fail to bolster confidence among homebuyers. Home sales in the US stayed at 288,000 a year in August, the same level as July and the second lowest since records began in 1963. Average prices fell to a level not seen since December 2003, according to figures from the Commerce Department. "There is no upside momentum in housing, period," said Eric Green, chief market economist at TD Securities in New York who correctly forecast the level of sales. "Unemployment is so high, consumer confidence is so low, household wealth is eroded and the psychology remains negative." August's durable goods report, suggested the recovery in the manufacturing sector has faded significantly. This was shown by the slowdown in the three-month on three-month growth rate of core orders from 26.2% in May to -4.1%." The only bright spot was a report that showed orders for capital equipment rebounded in August, signalling business investment is holding up better than some economists projected. Michael Woolfolk, an analyst at Bank of New York Mellon said the wild swings in US data meant it was difficult to draw conclusions from one month's figures. "The devil continues to be in the detail of this report, as large swings in commercial aircraft and defence orders cause the headline to consistently miss consensus expectations. While the headline number was a modest disappointment, everything else proved positive." Stock markets focused on the capital investment figures, which were positive for the third month in the last four, and better than expected figures from across the eurozone. The FTSE 100 finished up 51 points at 5598, while the German Dax and French CAC bourses were up almost 2%. The Dow rose 1.75% at 10,848. Markets also welcomed the budget cuts and investments in job creation by the Spanish government. Earlier, the news that German business confidence unexpectedly rose in September, as measured by the Ifo Institute, was diluted by the fact that most businesses in Europe's biggest economy expect tougher conditions in the months ahead as the global economic recovery slows down.

Brazil's oil firm Petrobras aims for largest share issue in history Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petrobras is aiming to sell a record-breaking $64bn (£41bn) worth of shares to investors this week – the latest and biggest sign of the developing nation's recent ascent through the ranks of world finance. The offering is set to become the largest issue to date, surpassing the $36bn raised by Japanese telecoms company NTT in 1987 and the $24bn raised by the Royal Bank of Scotland in June 2008, when the lender rushed to inflate its corporate buffers as the credit crunch started to deepen. Investors are flocking to emerging markets, bonds and natural resources as they escape moribund equity markets in Europe and the US. Meanwhile, developing economies such as Brazil are booming as they sell oil, minerals and metals at record prices. Their financial systems have also been less battered by the credit crunch than those in the west, as their more traditional banks avoided the complex sub-prime lending deals that led to the global recession. Rio-based Petrobras, an offshore oil driller, will use the funds raised to help finance its $224bn investment plan through 2014. As many as 26 investment banks have been appointed to distribute the shares, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Banco Santander and Citigroup. Petrobras, already the fifth largest publicly listed oil and gas firm, aims to make Brazil one of the world's biggest oil exporters. It plans to tap oil buried under the sea floor in a region known as the subsalt. Deals such as Brazilian ethanol and sugar company ETH's purchase of rival Brenco have lifted Brazil to the world's number five rank in mergers and acquisitions this year – up from eighth over the same period last year – according to Dealogic. Only the US, Britain, China and Canada have struck more deals than the South American country. Brazil is also ranked seven in terms of equity issues – up from 10th last year – and 21st in debt transactions, a jump from its 29th rank in 2009. Banks are expanding their operations in Sao Paulo, Brasilia or Rio as they try to exploit the country's rich mineral reserves, including iron ore, aluminium or copper. Brazil is also rich in soya beans, fruit, coffee, sugar and cotton. The Petrobras sale is also expected to attract interest from energy investors, who have rushed into natural resource companies as they perceive them to be safer than the recently volatile credit and equity markets. Gold last week reached a record of $1,274 per troy ounce, while Exchange Traded Funds have proliferated in stock markets across Europe as investors seek exposure to commodities and energy. In the meantime, the FTSE 100 has barely gained 1.8% this year. Utility and energy is the second biggest generator of equity issues in Europe so far this year, with $8.4bn worth of transactions. Only banks have issued more, worth $17bn.

Ocado's going cheap, say analysts – but not that cheap Funnily enough, everyone seems to the think are shares are cheap at the current price of 142p. Goldman Sachs thinks they are worth 200p and HSBC opts for 190p. UBS's analyst comes the closest to stepping out of line by declaring fair value at 167p, or 13p below the eventual float price. Hold on. Wasn't Ocado's original ambition to sell shares in a 200p-275p range? Indeed it was. Surely there must be an analyst out there prepared to venture towards the mid-point of that range? If not, the original valuation range would look even crazier than it did at the time. Don't be shy, the reputations of your investment banking colleagues on the other side of the Chinese walls are at stake.

Lacklustre stock markets halt autumn floats   An array of rumoured flotations that were delayed during the financial crisis but tipped for revival this autumn have been shelved again on fears about the state of the capital markets. Goldman Sachs, the banker to Betfair and Virgin Active, has been talking up the prospects of both businesses floating this autumn, but advisers to the gym operator confirmed there was little chance of it seeking a listing this year. Sources close to Betfair suggested market conditions might also scupper the online betting exchange floating this autumn – a much-heralded £1.5bn float that would also be complicated by the fact that it would probably crystallise large losses for Softbank, the Japanese investor which has a 23% stake in the gambling business. Another Apax-owned business, the bureau de change group Travelex, was also reportedly considering tapping the equity markets this year, but it too plays down becoming a public company during 2010. Meanwhile, Blackstone-owned travel reservations company Travelport, which cancelled its £1.8bn flotation in February, said last month it had "no compunction to list". Equity analysts will also be watching closely for worsening economic news that could further undermine any remaining flotation plans over the next few weeks. "US third quarter GDP numbers are set to be announced later this month. That number could conceivably be negative, which would set the cat amongst the pigeons," said one.

World markets fall on economic fears Fears over the health of the global economy sent shares falling sharply around the world this morning. The sell-off was most pronounced in Japan, where a £6.9bn stimulus package announced yesterday by the Japanese government failed to impress investors. The Nikkei index shed more than 3.6% in a nervy trading session to close at 8824.06 points, its lowest level since April last year. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 70 points in early trading to a low of 5129.66, down 1.3%. There were also losses in other European markets, with the German DAX losing 1.1% and the French CAC down by 0.9%. The threat of a double-dip recession also continues to loom, according to Ben Potter, market strategist at IG Markets. "There's the idea that any rampant growth we're seeing now is merely going to end up as being the peak between two recessionary troughs," Potter warned. There was also concern that US personal incomes rose by just 0.2% last month, less than expected. David Buik of BGC Partners said this had "added credence to the thought process that the US economy is losing momentum and is wilting under pressure". Yesterday the Bank of Japan announced new measures to encourage Japanese banks to lend to each other. This was swiftly followed by a ¥900bn ($6.9bn) stimulus package, but this was denounced as too timid to address Japan's problems. The yen is hovering around a 15-year high against the dollar, hurting the country's exporters.

Stock markets World stock markets fall as fears of a double-dip recession in the US fan fears for global economic recovery
 ~~~~ 
US new house sales hit record low The FTSE 100 sank to a seven-week low last night as fresh gloom from the US raised the prospect of recession gripping the global economy once again. A record low for sales of new US homes combined with news of stuttering orders for manufacturers to underline fears that the world's largest economy could be heading for a double-dip downturn. Speculation grew that central bankers will be forced to step in with fresh support for the fledgling recovery as the US government said new orders for durable goods such as cars, machinery and household appliances rose a meagre 0.3% last month. That was well below the 2.8% rise forecast by analysts. Stocks opened lower on Wall Street, oil prices fell and the dollar weakened after the data. Shares remained in the red as separate data followed showing new single family home sales slid 12.4% in July to a 276,000 annual rate. That was the lowest since records began in 1963 and confounded expectations for the pace to hold steady. With investors fretting about knock-on effects globally following a series of downbeat US indicators, the FTSE 100 ended down 46.6 points, or 0.9%, at 5109.4, the lowest close since early July. Yields on 10-year UK government bonds set a fresh record low of 2.79% as US jitters continued to fuel a rush for safe-haven assets. "The US housing market is imploding alongside its economy; poor manufacturing, retail and activity surveys have stripped away the veneer of an American recovery and the market has realised that the emperor is not wearing any clothes," said Jeremy Cook, chief economist, currency exchange broker World First. "As a result, 'haven' assets such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc are powering to record highs and the yield on government debt is tumbling as investors continue their flight to quality." Economists raised particular concerns over signs in the orders data that investment by US companies was stalling and so was unlikely to provide support to the wider economy. Orders for capital goods unexpectedly slumped 8%, excluding the defence sector and aircraft. Rob Carnell, at ING Financial Markets, predicted that business investment growth would slow in the third quarter, "which will cost around 1 percentage point of GDP growth, and keep fears of a double dip and more quantitative easing on investors' minds". It was the prospect of more support from central bankers in the form of quantitative easing (QE) or fresh government stimulus packages that helped to contain losses on US stock markets. After an initial drop on Wall Street that saw the Dow Jones industrial average topple through the psychologically important 10,000 mark, shares regained some poise by the time London closed. With mid-term congressional elections in November, pressure is mounting on the Obama administration to adopt further measures to boost the economy. For investors, the recent flow of weak figures has also increased the prospect of the US central bank embarking on more QE - a system whereby it buys securities in the market and thereby pumps electronic money into the economy. Markets will be scouring a speech on Friday by Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, for any hints. The US Federal Reserve's policy committee under the leadership of Bernanke has reportedly become increasingly split over how much more support is needed and when. The picture will become clearer when the Federal Open Market committee publishes the minutes from its latest meeting next week. According to the Wall Street Journal, the gathering was "among the most contentious" in Bernanke's four-and-a-half year tenure as Fed chairman. The newspaper described divisions over the technical issue of how the Fed manages the portfolio of securities that has built up during its QE spree. At the same time there was a more fundamental debate over what action to take next over the spluttering recovery and weak inflation. At the 10 August meeting, the Fed took a cautious step towards pumping extra liquidity into the financial system through an operation described as "QE lite". It decided to reinvest the proceeds of its maturing holdings of mortgage-backed securities by putting the funds into Treasury bonds. But many economists believe the move will be followed by more full-blown QE before the end of the year.

US investors win right to challenge runaway boardroom pay packets Investors have won enhanced powers to challenge runaway pay packets and poor management at the top of the US business world under contentious rules approved today that make it easier for shareholders to unseat directors of Wall Street-listed companies. In an outcome cheered by unions but vehemently opposed by business lobbyists, the securities and exchange commission voted by a narrow margin of 3-2 to allow investors holding more than 3% of a company's stock to put their own nominees for boardroom seats on election ballots sent out in advance of annual meetings. The change amounts to a historic shift in the balance of power in the US corporate world, where shareholders have traditionally had only very limited sway over the direction of companies. "As a matter of fairness and accountability, long-term significant shareholders should have a means of nominating candidates to the boards of the companies they own," said the SEC's chairman, Mary Schapiro, who described the change as one of the most contentious issues ever addressed by her agency. To date, investors who want to nominate board members have had to finance their own proxy battles and pay for mailshots to shareholders – an expensive and cumbersome process that only well-resourced fund management firms or activist billionaires have been able to afford. An umbrella organisation of US unions, the AFL-CIO, applauded the greater access afforded by the provision, which is likely to be used to challenge multimillion-dollar boardroom bonuses. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, described it as "an important and historic step in empowering long-term investors". Not everybody, however, is pleased. Business leaders portray it as an unwelcome distraction, arguing that it will force companies to devote valuable time and resources at the height of an economic slowdown to challenges brought by special interest groups. David Hirschmann, head of capital markets competitiveness at the US Chamber of Commerce, described it as "a giant step backwards" for average investors: "Using the proxy process to give labour union pension funds and others greater leverage to try to ram through their agenda makes no sense."

Shareholder trading values Facebook at more than $33bn Facebook is now being valued at more than $33bn (£21.3bn) as investors try to secure a stake in the social networking site in anticipation of its flotation on the US stock market. The latest data shows that shares in Facebook are changing hands for up to $76 each, more than double their value at the start of this year. While Facebook is still privately held, shareholders are able to sell the company's stock through "secondary market" trading. By buying at these prices, some investors are calculating that Facebook is worth more than eBay or Dell, or nearly twice as much as Yahoo!. Secondary market trading can artificially inflate the value of a private company, as the relative scarcity of its shares may encourage a buyer to overpay. But with founder Mark Zuckerberg thought to be planning to float Facebook in the next couple of years, there is already strong interest in what would be the tech sector's biggest IPO since Google went public six years ago. Technology and internet companies tend to be valued on relatively high "multiples" – the ratio of their market capitalisation to their annual earnings. Apple, for example, was worth $219bn when Wall Street closed last night and is expected to deliver profits of nearly $13bn in 2010. That gives Apple a price-to-earnings ratio of around 17x based on this year's performance. Yahoo has a p/e ratio of almost 22x, while Google's p/e ratio is 19.5x. It is also benefiting from the smartphone boom – communications regulator Ofcom reported last week that 45% of all mobile internet use in the UK was spent on Facebook. However, it has repeatedly faced criticism over privacy issues, and users may resist efforts to "mine" their personal information so it can be used to drive revenue growth. In 2007, Facebook sold a 1.6% stake to Microsoft for $240m, a deal that valued the whole social networking firm at $15bn. This was after Zuckerberg had rejected a $1bn takeover offer from Yahoo!. He also reportedly rebuffed Microsoft's efforts to buy the whole company. An IPO might not happen until 2012, and some technology analysts believe there is still time for Zuckerberg to receive an offer he cannot refuse. "Microsoft could used Facebook as a portal for all their cloud services. They could include MS Office, and a prominent Bing search box," Holway suggested. "Apple popularised the app, and Facebook is the most used app of all. Both Facebook and Apple apps bypass Google main revenue stream – sponsored search. Google is the company with the most to fear right now." (market capitalisation based on last night's closing prices)

Markets shaken by weakness of US goods orders Financial markets were spooked again today by US double-dip fears as orders for durable goods were weaker than expected and American companies appeared to cut back investment sharply. Stocks opened lower on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 extended its losses, oil prices fell and the dollar weakened as the US government said new orders for durable goods such as cars, machinery and household appliances rose a meagre 0.3% last month. This was much lower than the 2.8% rise forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Excluding equipment for the transport sector – seen as particularly volatile – orders fell 3.8%, the biggest drop for 18 months, and confounded expectations for a modest 0.5% rise. Rob Carnell at ING Financial Markets said the durable goods numbers "throw more doubt on the resilience of the US recovery" and that business investment growth was likely to slow in the third quarter, "which will cost around 1 percentage point of GDP growth, and keep fears of a double dip and more quantitative easing on investors minds". Aneta Markowska at Société Générale painted a similar outlook: "After strong business investment figures in the second quarter which look on track to be revised up, we are likely to see a significant loss of momentum in the second half of the year. Durable data reaffirms the recent weakness in regional manufacturing surveys and suggests that the resiliency in industrial production figures is unlikely to last." The data follows news yesterday that US home sales slumped twice as fast as expected last month, to hit a 15-year low. Those figures rattled stock markets in the US and Europe, and government bonds rallied as investors sought out safe-haven investments. Today the FTSE 100 was down more than 1.2%, or 64 points, at 5091.5, extending losses of about 50 points before the durable goods data. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped about 30 points, or 0.3%, to 10009 at the opening bell on Wall Street, putting it on track for the fifth straight session of losses. On UK government bond markets, yields on 10-year gilts set a fresh record low of 2.79%. Traders will have more to go on at 3pm in the UK when US new home sales data is published.
