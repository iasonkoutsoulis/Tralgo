Deutsche Bank says Tory victory best for UK stock market Well here's a surprise. Or possibly not. The City thinks a Conservative victory in the forthcoming election would be the best outcome for the stock market. The best result for UK equities is likely to be an outright victory for the Conservative party. Although an outright Labour victory would help create certainty, the lack of urgency in their deficit reduction plans may be negative for gilt yields and may alert the rating agencies. But he adds a caveat: If gilt yields aren't negatively impacted by a Labour victory then their 'spending for longer' policy may actually be better for markets than a Conservative administration committed to fiscal cut-backs. Ironically mild sovereign concerns are also positive for UK equities. Around 65% of FTSE 100 revenues come from overseas and therefore benefit from currency weakness. Clearly there is a fine line here and the risk is that sovereign weakness eventually hits gilt yields. So arguably the most important thing to watch in the days, weeks and months ahead is how gilt yields respond to the new administration. If they can retain the confidence of the gilt market then we can have a more optimistic path ahead than if they lose such confidence. On a hung parliament, Deutsche says: As for a Conservative majority: And finally, if Labour manage to buck the polls and hold on to power: Some of the companies exposed to spending cuts that may have underperformed in anticipation of a Conservative win may see a relief rally (mainly smaller companies). However, the problem of government finances remains and there is no guarantee that the risk of a sovereign downgrade would be averted. A continuation of the current loose policy framework is likely to be inflationary and bearish for gilts. We may see better performances from IT services, aerospace and the housebuilders (top pick Barratt) if Labour retain a majority.

Barclays executive nets £9m in shares payout Although not on Barclays' board, Ricci's dealings have been disclosed because he is deemed to be a "person discharging managerial responsibility" after joining the executive committee in November 2009. It is difficult to ascertain how many shares he continues to hold as the bank is not required to provide such information.

Falkland Islands drilling disappoints for Desire The prospect of a new oil boom off the coast of the Falklands Islands has been dealt a heavy blow after the first well yielded disappointing results. Desire Petroleum told the stock market this morning that exploratory drilling beneath the seabed surrounding the South Atlantic territory had found oil deposits, but warned that early evidence suggests they may not be commercially viable. The bad news sent its shares tumbling more than 50%, and hit other companies in the sector. Desire was the first company to put Ocean Guardian to use. It dug more than 3,500 metres, and hit hydrocarbon deposits around 2,550 metres. However, early analysis showed "that oil may be present in thin intervals but that reservoir quality is poor". It warned that until it has analysed the data further it will not know whether the well needs to be "drilled deeper, suspended for testing or plugged and abandoned". Shares in Desire plunged by nearly 60% when trading began, down 58p at 41p. Rockhopper Exploration, which owned 7% of Desire's well, tumbled 35%. Desire is expected to announce further results from the well, called Liz 14/19-1, later this week. Alan Sinclair, analyst at stockbrokers Seymour Pierce, argued that all may not be lost. "On balance, whilst the market may have been looking for seagull-scorching test results from Liz, it should be borne in mind that this is the first of a potential six-well programme by Desire. It is encouraging that initial indications suggest that potentially all the ingredients – reservoir, trap and hydrocarbons – are present in the general area," he wrote in a research note.

Lloyds banking chief in line for £6m cash and shares payout The 5.1m shares – currently worth £3.2m – were made under a long-term plan and come on top of 3.6m shares worth almost £2m when awarded at 55p last year and will pay out in 2012 depending performance targets are reached. He also has a £1.1m salary and benefits deal. Angry shareholders, including UK Financial Investments – which looks after the taxpayers' stake in the bailed-out banks – appear to have convinced the bank's remuneration committee to promise to take more care in deciding bonuses next year. In his statement in the annual report, Berndt said: "Reflecting shareholder concern on this matter, the committee will review performance against the targets for the 2010 plans, taking into account the overall operating performance in the business in determining how much any bonus will be paid out. "The committee also reserves the right to exercise its discretion in reducing any payment that otherwise would have been earned, if they deem this appropriate." But he also expresses concern about the overall pay levels. "The committee does have concerns that by continuing to hold base pay levels at 2008 levels, remuneration for the executive directors is likely to become uncompetitive versus our peer group," he said. Daniels' base salary of £1m is enhanced by benefits that took his total pay to £1.1m – down on the £1.5m he received in 2008. Truett Tate, who runs the wholesale bank, was the highest paid director on the board with a £640,000 salary topped by a £1.1m bonus to take his total to £1.8m. Finance director Tim Tookey had a £1.1m bonus to take his pay to £1.7m, while Helen Weir, who heads the retail bank, had a £1m bonus to take home £1.7m. The other boardroom executive Archie Kane who runs the investment arm received £1.5m, including a £885,000 bonus. The bonuses are paid in shares and will be released in 2012. The annual report shows that former chairman Sir Victor Blank, who was forced to promise to step down before last year's annual meeting and eventually left in September, continued to be paid until the end of January 2010. He donated the £213,333 he received since September to charity. Until then he received £683,000. The new chairman Sir Win Bischoff is on £700,000. A spokesman for Lloyds stressed that the boardroom bosses would only receive the shares they had been awarded if the performance conditions were met. "They will only be awarded if very significant value is created for shareholders," the spokesman said.

Will Japan's investment funds blossom again? Neptune's economist, James Dowey, chips in with dismal figures on Japan's GDP. It's ¥500tn (£3.7tn), but was at the same nominal level more than a decade ago. This is a country that is flatlining. How do corporates react in such an unfavourable environment? The answer is to cut investment, capital expenditure and wages. And in aggregate, it means no one increases their bottom line. Companies can't raise profitability and face a vicious downward spiral. So why has he brought a group of financial journalists to Tokyo? To write that investors should dump his fund? This has got to be the oddest press trip on record … But Taylor hasn't lost his marbles. He doesn't buy Japan. What he buys is Japanese companies. In sector after sector, he says he can find three or four companies that are world class and which are often the dominant global player in their market. He takes us to Toray Industries. In the 1950s it was competing against Britain's Courtaulds in the rayon market. Soon, Toray was facing the same sort of price competition that drove Courtaulds from the market. But instead of rolling over it invested in research and development, seeking new markets for materials. Now it's the world leader in carbon-fibre technology with global sales of some $12bn (£7.9bn). Half its manufacturing plants are in Japan, and inevitably the business took a hammering when demand imploded as the global recession began to bite. Its response says a lot about Japanese capitalism. Senior vice-president Norihiko Saitou tells us it embarked on cost-cutting which included 30% pay cuts for board members, the axing of bonuses for managers and the end of overtime. But redundancies were out of the question. "It is a very important company policy not to lay off people," he tells us, through an interpreter. It has a 30-year plan for carbon fibres, a lightweight material that is replacing steel in aeroplanes and cars, and so substantially reduces weight and energy use. Boeing has signed it up to supply materials for its Dreamliner.It's this approach which may explain why Toray is a world leader and Courtaulds a shadow of its former self. And Toray's share price is around ¥505, up 43% from ¥353 last March. Taylor reckons scores of Japanese companies such as Toray are ideally placed to benefit from not just the recovery in world trade but the coming boom. Global GDP was $55tn in 2007. He believes it will be $80tn by 2015, but most of that growth will be in non-OECD countries. "The Chinese haven't even begun to gear up," he says. Japan is the biggest investor in China, directly and through companies the Japanese control in Taiwan. Taylor's strategy is to buy Japanese multinationals, avoid stocks exposed to the moribund domestic economy and hedge the currency. He is a big fan of hedging and warns of the value traps that so often ensnare investors in Japan. His analysis of global debt took him out of banks and real estate in 2007. He's back in financials and multinationals now but is fully hedged in the belief that the yen will fall. He finds the domestic economic situation in Japan almost comically bad, with a paralysed and corrupted political class unable to cope with the daunting challenges of a rapidly ageing population and colossal fiscal deficit. Shigeki Morinobu, president of the Japan Tax Institute, shows us a graph that makes Alistair Darling's budget challenge look like child's play. Government spending this year will be around ¥100tn, tax receipts around ¥37tn. Japan is hooked on government spending so far in excess of what it raises in taxes that it just can't find a way out. Much of that money goes on pensions and healthcare for the elderly, where the bill just keeps rising. Government debt has topped 200% of GDP, and financing it from famously thrifty Japanese households can't go on much longer. The savings ratio has plummeted from 20% of national income two decades ago to 2% today. Crunch time for Japan could come in the 2011 budget. Government spending, which has propped up the economy since the bubble burst in the early 1990s, must fall. Taxes may have to rise. Either way, it makes the prospect for the domestic economy grim. But it will force a substantial devaluation of the yen, which will help Taylor's holdings in those Japanese multinationals. JO Hambro's Scott McGlashan, who has one of the longest records of investing in Japan, believes 2010 will be a strong year for the Tokyo stock market. "On most metrics, Japanese equities are near historically cheap levels," he says. "Strong research and development bodes well for Japanese trade and innovation over the long term." But investment consultant Allenbridge warns that Japan has been the most disappointing major stock market in the world over the past 20 years, with the Nikkei 225 at barely a quarter of its 1989 peak. "There have been false dawns galore, with 'stale' bulls pinning their hopes on the old saw of what goes down must eventually go up. There have been short-term blips but it has been a depressing long-term experience." However it now believes Tokyo "may finally offer good opportunities, provided investors pick carefully".

Lloyds predicts return to profit Lloyds Banking Group cheered its long-suffering shareholders this morning by predicting a return to profit this year, after incurring fewer bad debts than feared in recent weeks. The bank, which is 41% owned by the taxpayer following its takeover of HBOS two years ago, told the City that trading had been "strong" in the first 10 weeks of the year. It is keeping a tight lid on costs, which are lower than in the same period in 2009. The bank's net interest margin is still in line with recent guidance and this has supported "a good level of income growth". "Impairment provisions are currently trending at lower levels than anticipated and as a result the group now expects to deliver a better impairment performance than previously guided, in both the retail and corporate businesses, in 2010," Lloyds said in an unscheduled trading statement. "Overall … the group believes that it will be profitable on a combined businesses basis in 2010." The upbeat statement boosted shares in Britain's banks, and sent Lloyds shares up 8% to 60p in early trading. Royal Bank of Scotland gained nearly 6% to 44.45p, and Barclays rose almost 2% to 359.6p. "We did this impromptu update because there is a material improvement in the performance," said a Lloyds spokesman. "We felt in the ten weeks of trading since Christmas the trends are better than we expected. These are the first signs of an encouraging performance in the year ahead." But he added that the improvement is "not really a reflection of general market conditions" but specific to Lloyds' customers. Today's comments will calm fears about UK banks after Standard & Poor's warned yesterday that lenders remain vulnerable to a deterioration in loan quality and money markets. The rating agency said there is "limited scope" for banks to increase profits over the next two years. "Into 2010, we consider that UK banks will remain pressured by elevated loan impairments. Our expectation of a slow economic recovery may prolong the period in which losses are elevated relative to historic averages," S&P said in a report. Analysts at Redburn Partners noted that the commercial property market ended 2009 on a high with an 8% rise in capital values in the fourth quarter, underpinned by the highest level of investment activity since autumn 2007. "This has materially positive ramifications for Lloyds' most troubled loan book." Lloyds will update on trading again on 27 April. Today's comments are part of a presentation which Daniels will give to investors at the Morgan Stanley European financials conference on Wednesday. "In general banks have been very bullish in client meetings post their results. Given that interest rates are at a 350-year low, it is not surprising that credit quality is improving," said Bruce Packard at Seymour Pierce. "But UK households are around three times more indebted than during the early 1990s recession, and consensus forecasts for growth look far too optimistic compared to how the banks grew income coming out of the last recession."

Bartle Bogle Hegarty takes attack alarm spin-off to stock market Bartle Bogle Hegarty has taken to heart the advice about diversifying beyond advertising agencies' traditional creative work, with the stock market floatation of a subsidiary company that produces fashionable assault alarms for women. BBH, which in many ways is the archetypal traditional ad agency with a reputation built on TV commercials for brands such as Levi's, Audi and British Airways, has nevertheless been trying to develop new revenue streams for the past four years by inventing and developing new brands through a division called Zag. Zag's goal has been to concentrate on what BBH has termed "brandlag" – areas of the market where consumer activity is ahead of the products so far launched. Now one of the businesses developed by Zag, Ila Security, has been floated on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim). Ila, which produces a personal alarm that looks like a mobile phone and produces a piercing scream at 120 decibels to help protect women from assault, has already been selling in stores such as Marks & Spencer and Next. The business, which currently only produces the Ila Dusk alarm for women "who want security without compromising on style", floated on Aim on Friday with a market value of more than £4.5m following a reverse takeover of Baylon Holdings. "The Ila listing represents a significant validation of our business model," said Neil Munn, the former Unilever global brand director who joined BBH to set up the Zag venture in early 2006. Ila is now aiming to launch five more products – Ila Sport, Ila Hook, Ila Wedge, Ila Pebble and Ila Leash – in the coming months. Last year BBH produced a major campaign for the Ila Dusk.

Debt-ridden theme park operator Merlin says sales are up 6.4% The Luxembourg-registered group behind Legoland, the London Dungeon, Madame Tussauds, the London Eye and Alton Towers is among a handful of large private equity-owned groups backed by the US buyout house Blackstone whose flotation plans are being watched. A London listing for the private equity group travel booking business Travelport was postponed last month. Exit plans have yet to emerge for Blackstone's investments in United Biscuits and Tragus, the restaurant group behind Cafe Rouge and Strada. Blackstone has in recent weeks been among the buyout firms to have attracted criticism over the level of fees sought from prospective investors. Some $140m (£93m) had been sought in connection with aborted attempts to list Travelport to help cover transaction advisory costs. Merlin, which has external net borrowings of about £1bn, published selective figures for the year to 26 December today , which it said showed "the resilience of our business model". It is not expected to publish its statutory accounts for some months. Nick Varney, chief executive, said: "We are delighted with Merlin's performance in 2009. In the midst of a deep global recession we welcomed over three million more visitors to our attractions." Asked about plans for a stock market flotation, Varney said: "News of the demise of our plans to IPO [initial public offering] are somewhat premature." With no major debts maturing before 2012, he claimed Merlin was "under no immediate pressure" to find an exit route for its private-equity backers. It emerged last month that one of Blackstone's fellow investors in Merlin, Dubai International Capital, had quietly sold two-thirds of its 18% equity holding in the business to the founding Lego family, led by Kjeld Kirk Kirstiansen, as long ago as last summer. The transaction saw the family increase its interest to 34%, making it the second-largest investor behind Blackstone, which has 50%. Merlin does not own the Lego toy brand, which remains under family control. Merlin said it raised comparable revenue to £720m, up 6.4% on an underlying basis. It also generated cash of £234m from operations. Of that, £101m went on capital investment, a similar sum on interest and a some on paying off a revolving debt facility.

AA and Saga float falls by the wayside Acromas Holdings, the merged AA and Saga group, has become the latest ­private equity-owned business to abandon plans to float on the stock market this year, reflecting a new militancy among institutions refusing to back businesses with huge debts. The decision comes amid growing concerns about the future of swaths of British companies that are shouldering debts raised by the private equity ­industry during the boom years, and warnings that tens of thousands of jobs could be at risk. Acromas has £6bn of borrowings and was widely tipped as a prime candidate for listing, but senior managers have now taken the unusual step for a private equity-financed vehicle of ruling out a float for at least 12 months. Despite Acromas's steep borrowings, its executives argue that potential investors will look beyond the numbers when it eventually seeks a public listing. "I think investors will focus on the strength of the management, the strength of the brand and the strength of the underlying business," said ­Stuart Howard, Acromas's chief financial officer. "But I accept that the discussion on the appropriate level of debt for the business will be important." The owners of Acromas – CVC Capital Partners, Permira and Charterhouse – are among the three biggest names in private equity. They will have to convince potential investors that raising cash on the stock market is more about funding future growth than paying down huge debt. It is a challenge emblematic of issues facing the wider leveraged buyout community, which has racked up a $3tn (£1.9tn) leveraged buyout, property and securitisation debt pile. That mountain of bank borrowing is seen by many experts on distressed debt as an economic and corporate car crash waiting to happen. The vast majority of the $3tn debt needs refinancing in a five-year time­frame starting in 2012. Experts believe up to 60% of loans will fail. This implies a huge number of private equity-owned firms – estimated to be almost a fifth of corporate Britain – will fold, having a potentially devastating impact on jobs. Failure to refinance loans will see private equity firms hit with swingeing financial penalties. The need to repay debt ahead of that deadline is why private equity wants to find exits. The longer it holds investments, the more of its debt it has to repay. And the more likely it is that subsequent private equity fundraising will also fail. "The private equity model is based on the idea that the period of ownership is reasonably limited," a senior investment manager said. "If the period holding [a company] is longer, it makes it harder to attract new money. For investors, they rely on returns to finance the next round. "And I don't think debt markets will come back to the level they were in 2006," the manager said. Therefore, there will be refinancing issues. It's a big problem looming." Already, investors in private equity are taking fright. In a report out last week from the financial research group Preqin, 25% of investment managers said they were unsure when they would next invest in a private equity funding round. A further 8% were not planning to invest for at least a year. This represents a sea change in sentiment. In 1999, institutional investment totalled $329bn, rising to $929bn in 2009. Most of this cash came from ­pension funds. Those same pension funds have been called on to back public listings but since Debenhams, the high-street retailer, raised £950m in 2006, its shares have fallen 66%. Of the world's 20 biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) involving private equity in 2006 and 2007 – the peak of the last IPO cycle – only six trade above their offer prices, according to Thomson Reuters data. "The definition of solvency is based on a company's ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due and that is exactly what we do," Howard said. The company's auditors certainly have no reason to disagree with this, and a ­simple analysis of the cash available to Acromas also confirms Howard's assertion. At the year end, it had £140m of available cash, an increase of £30m. This is all underpinned by a trading ­performance that is seemingly coping well with difficult economic circumstances. "The business is performing in line with plans, and cash generation is ahead of expectations because of falling interest rates," Howard said. "We have no need to tap the markets." But despite such confidence, there is still a sense that Acromas is running up the down escalator. Not only does it have to deal with an unhelpful trading environment but it must do so under the strains imposed by carrying more than £6bn of debt. Available cash may have increased by £30m but net debt rose £269m. Acromas records an annual interest charge of more than £700m. The cash cost is somewhat less than that because £266m of interest costs are simply added to loan instruments held by investors. These subordinated preference certificates attract interest at an effective rate of 16.5%. They may not be repayable until 2037 but they represent an ever increasing debt burden. The Acromas management also takes comfort from the fact that its debt was provided under a "covenant-light" regime. A powerful and successful industry used its pre-credit crunch credentials to persuade banks to be less stringent in the conditions they imposed on companies to safeguard their lending. A more restrictive covenant regime may have been less sympathetic to the Acromas balance sheet, which boasts only £227m of tangible fixed assets and £426m of net current assets to support £6bn of debt. The last thing Acromas needs is ­deteriorating relations with its workforce. And yet, the AA section of the group is threatened with industrial action for the first time in its history. Restrictions to its defined contributions pension scheme could spark strikes among a workforce that has already seen the loss of 4,000 jobs since falling under private equity ownership four years ago. While Acromas may have its debt financed under covenant-light terms, it must hope that nothing untoward affects the day-to-day business as it tries to repay banks and inch towards an exit. Alliance Boots boasts of its "commitment to be at the forefront of best practice corporate governance reporting". It cites publication of its financial statement as an example of its transparency. But trying to unravel what is really going on behind the figures set out in the high-street chemist chain's latest accounts for the year ended March 2009 is far from easy. Since the company is so heavily geared, it is important to be able to gauge the true extent of its financial liabilities. But here the accounts become less transparent. The carrying value of borrowings on the balance sheet is £9.6bn. But the accounts also provide a figure for the contractual maturity of its financial liabilities, which includes the interest costs relating to those borrowings. On that basis, the borrowings rise to £13.5bn. Alliance Boots has total financial liabilities on the balance sheet of £12.2bn, which rise to £16.2bn on a contractual maturity basis. To confuse matters further, it is clear from the accounts that none of these figures bears any relationship to what is going on in the real world of the debt markets. A note to the accounts on exceptional items reveals that the market price of the company's debt had been savaged by the turmoil of the credit crunch. Alliance Boots bought back some its own debt, principally mezzanine finance, with a nominal value of £191m. But the price it paid in the market yielded a discount of £106m – the ultimate buy one get one free. Despite its huge debt mountain, Alliance Boots still boasts net assets in excess of £4bn. However, more than £10bn, well over half its total assets, are represented by intangibles such as goodwill and brands.  When the private equity deal was struck in 2007, the company envisaged using its tangible assets to refinance the balance sheet. A sale and leaseback of property and securitisation of receivables were seen as ways to help cut debt. But neither deal made financial sense against a backdrop of market turmoil and falling interest rates. Lower interest rates work to the company's advantage but it still had to shoulder finance costs in excess of £1bn in the year to March. Once these have been met there is not much by way of surplus. The company made pre-tax profits of just £13m. Of the £30m of free cash generated, about £17m was whittled away by currency translations. Andy Hornby, group chief executive, delivered an upbeat message last month when reporting on the third-quarter performance. But he recognised that 2010 would be another tough year. Alliance Boots may not have to start making its biggest debt repayments until 2014 but  a difficult trading environment combined with unforgiving financial markets can only accelerate the point at which it begins to contemplate more aggressively that imposing milestone  – or is it millstone?

Superdry owner SuperGroup plans stock-market flotation It is understood that SuperGroup will launch institutional and retail share offers, raising about £125m to fund expansion plans and allowing management to take some cash off the table. The three would have had valuations of between £1.2bn and £2bn, and blamed the volatile market for forcing them to call off their plans. However, all three are private equity backed, and some fund managers are known to have balked at their high valuations and levels of debt. Had they joined the market successfully, there was a long queue of other private equity-backed companies hoping to follow suit. One industry expert said that the prospect of an IPO was a "last get-out-of-jail card" for many private equity-owned businesses, which could now face difficult refinancing problems and the prospect of being taken over by their lenders in debt-for-equity swaps. New Look had hoped to raise £650m to pay down some of its £1bn debt pile, which includes a hugely expensive "payment in kind" loan agreement, taken out to pay a dividend to the retailer's backers. The fashion chain is controlled by the private-equity groups Permira and Apax Partners, with its founder, Tom Singh, and the management also owning sizeable stakes. Another firm, Promethean, which is behind the whiteboards used in schools across the world, is also expected to confirm plans for an IPO today. Although it is private equity backed, it has not been saddled with huge debts. SuperGroup, however, is debt free. The brand, launched only six years ago, is the brainchild of Julian Dunkerton, whose chain of Cult boutiques is also part of SuperGroup, and James Holder, who previously developed the Bench label. Dunkerton, who started his business in 1985 with a market stall and a £40-a-week grant under Margaret Thatcher's enterprise allowance scheme, owns 52% of the business, while Holder and sales director Theo Karpathios account for 20%. SuperGroup could be valued at up to £400m and a successful float would turn all three into multimillionaires. Cheltenham-based Superdry, and its trademark orange label, have reached near-cult status among teenagers and twentysomethings. It sells a range of street-style clothing and has celebrity fans such as David Beckham and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, even though it does not pay famous faces to endorse its clothes. Last month it unveiled a 29% increase in like-for-like sales in the five weeks to Christmas, on top of a 27% rise the previous year. Total sales over the past year almost doubled to £119m. The group, which employs 1,000 staff, opened 17 new stores last year, taking its total to 40. It also has 54 concessions in House of Fraser, where it is one of the best-selling labels. The Superdry brand is sold in 30 countries and the group also has wholesale and online operations. It is understood that Keith Edelman, a veteran retailer whose most recent job was as chief executive of Arsenal football club and who is a former Wal-Mart executive, have also been lined up. The ­company declined to comment on its ­flotation plans.

Promethean forges ahead with flotation The company behind the educational whiteboards used in schools across the world is understood to be planning to join the stock market, despite the decision by three far bigger companies to pull the plug on their own plans. Promethean, based in Blackburn, makes a range of hi-tech educational kit, including whiteboards and handheld classroom devices for children, and is expected to confirm next week – possibly as early as Monday – that it is pressing the button on an initial public offer likely to value the business at up to £500m. Although Promethean is backed by Apax, which invested in 2004, unlike other companies with private equity investors who have abandoned their IPOs in the last three days – New Look, Travelport and Merlin Entertainment – Promethean has not been saddled with massive debts. Apax is expected to sell its entire stake, which will be worth £100m-£125m. Promethean has carved itself a profitable niche in the educational technology sector and is second in the whiteboard market behind Canada's Smart Technologies. It leads the embryonic market for handheld classroom devices for pupils. The company also has an online community of more than half a million teachers worldwide who use its portal – Promethean Planet – to swap lesson plans and teaching tips. They can also download paid-for lesson plans. The company was founded just over a decade ago by Tony Cann, now vice-chairman, who owns just over 50% of the business. Howe and chief executive Jean-Yves Charlier, former boss of Colt Telecom, hold about 10% between them. Non-executives include film producer Lord Puttnam and Philip Rowley, former boss of AOL Europe.

New Look pulls planned stock market flotation Young fashion chain New Look's ambition to rejoin the stock market was dashed today as the private equity-owned retailer was forced to scrap its flotation plans. New Look blamed the "unfavourable market backdrop" and said it had been a "difficult decision". The sale prospectus had been due for publication on Monday, when bookbuilding – signing up investors – was due to begin. However, some fund managers had balked at being asked to put up cash to repay private equity debts. The float, announced only 10 days ago, was called off after a crisis board meeting this morning. It capped two days which have destroyed the hopes of the private equity sector for a series of big, successful stockmarket listings for their investments. If successful, the three big floats would have heralded a flood of other private equity-backed companies joining the market as a way for financiers to crystallise their profits. Their failure, said one private equity expert, represented PE's "last 'get out of jail' card" before some of the companies they bought face financial crisis. The collapse of the IPOs is also bad news for investment bankers, who had hoped the share offerings would have produced huge advisory fees. New Look was acquired by Permira and Apax Partners in 2004. Founder Tom Singh has a stake, as has the store's senior management team. Chief executive Carl McPhail said: "We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the initial public offering as a result of the considerable volatility in the equity markets." He said the group still wanted to return to the stock market: "We remain convinced of the strengths of the New Look business and its suitability as a public company. New Look remains a great business with a great future. We will re-evaluate our options when market conditions improve." Today, however, a New Look spokesman said the retailer would not be constrained by its inability to float: "They didn't have to do it at all. They have high levels of cash." The majority of the float proceeds had been earmarked to pay off an expensive £360m payment-in-kind loan, where interest rolls up and is repaid in a large sum at the end of the term. The PIK note was taken on to pay a dividend to New Look's backers and management. The backers and management had not revealed how many shares they were likely to cash in at flotation, but the listing would have turned the retailer's bosses into multi-millionaires. The decision to abandon the planned float is the second time the retailer's backers have failed to sell the business. A plan was dropped in 2007 when bids fell short of the company's target. Many now face the prospect of refinancing in a fragile market where banks are being very demanding. Some private equity experts believe many PE-backed businesses could now fall under the control of their lenders. Guy Fraser Sampson, a private equity expert at the Cass Business School, said the door slamming on IPOs was "very bad news for the private equity industry", which for some "was the last 'get out of jail' card for them to keep up returns". He said some PE-backed companies would be seized by their banks while investors who put cash into private equity funds "must get used to much lower returns". New Look may also have been hampered by suggestions that the prospects for retailers did not look good, as the impact of the recent VAT rise takes effect and tax rises loom. Retail shares have dropped more than 10% so far this year – double the decline in the FTSE-100. However, New Look had boasted about its market-beating sales growth and Don Williams, head of retail at accountants BDO, said it was the value being put on New Look that had caused it to fail, rather than the economic backdrop. "Conditions have definitely improved for retailers compared to this time last year and fashion, in particular, has seen like-for-like growth. The postponement of New Look's IPO should not be seen as an indication of trouble on the high street. It is still a buyer's market at a corporate level and as such, prices must be realistic," he said.

New Look pulls planned stock market flotation New Look has become the latest company to pull its planned stock market flotation, blaming turbulent markets. It is the second time in three years that the budget retailer, backed by private equity firms Permira and Apax, has abandoned plans for a float. It was hoping to raise £650m to cut its £1bn debt pile, but did not meet with much enthusiasm from fund managers. Carl McPhail, New Look's chief executive, said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange: "We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the initial public offering as a result of the considerable volatility in the equity markets. We remain convinced of the strengths of the New Look business and its suitability as a public company. We will re-evaluate our options when market conditions improve." While markets have expected a flurry of big stock market flotations this year, a number of companies have abruptly changed their minds in recent days.

Markets volatile after mixed US jobs figures The keenly awaited US jobs report has provoked a volatile reaction from the stock market, as investors tried to read the runes of the figures. In the event, US employers cut 20,000 jobs in January rather than the increase expected by the market. In truth, the range was so wide that the consensus was for a 27,000 rise but it veered from positive to negative. If the raw number was – overall – disappointing then the unemployment rate edged down from 10% to a five-month low of 9.7%, when everyone was expecting a slight increase to 10.1%. Apart from suggesting that once more the experts were not exactly on the ball, the figures sent the market scrambling for direction. The initial reaction from the FTSE was to show a 100-point fall, but this soon pulled back to a decline of just over 50 points. At the moment the index is down 59.50 at 5079.81. The US futures have recovered from suggesting a 70-point fall at the open to a 7-point decline. Once thing is certain, however, and that is the market's uncertainty.

Markets fall on widening deficit fears and rising US unemployment Doubts over Greece's ability to pay its debts extended to Spain, Portugal and eastern European countries, all labouring under high budget deficits. The cost of insuring $10m of Spain's sovereign debt rocketed to $162,000 (£103,000), twice as much as Britain and about four times the cost to insure Germany's bonds, according to Markit, the credit data provider. Portugal only raised €300m of the €500m it was expecting in a bond sale, further fuelling the uncertainty. In line with other leading European indexes, the FTSE 100 shed 2.2%, or 114 points, to close at 5,139.31, its lowest close in three months, with banks leading the way and shares in miners and oil companies under pressure from lower oil and commodity prices. In New York, the Dow Jones slipped below the 10,000 mark at one stage before closing 268 points lower at 10,002, a fall of 2.61%, after figures unexpectedly showed a rise in new claims for jobless benefits, raising fears that tomorrow's key non-farm payrolls data could be worse than expected. The Dow Jones has now fallen by more than 6.5% during the last two weeks. The US data also hit commodity and currency markets, amid investors' concerns about a double-dip recession. "There is a renewed bout of risk aversion, there were expectations that the [US jobs] number would trend lower," said Tim Rees, a fund manager at Insight Investment. "Although some company results were pretty good, the market is finding reasons to be bearish." Spain's economy minister, Elena Salgado, this week announced €50bn of budget cuts aimed at reducing the budget deficit to 3% of GDP – the European target – from a revised 11.4% at present. Spaniards are under pressure from the international financial community, as it will force the government to pay more for its debt.

New Look to raise £650m in stock market flotation The fashion chain said it would use the cash being raised to cut its debt to £450m. With a much lower interest bill, said chief executive Carl McPhail, the retailer would be able to plough more cash into expansion plans. The company, majority-owned by private equity groups Apax and Permira, is likely to be valued at £1.7bn. It was taken private in 2004 in a £700m deal and the retailer says £450m has been invested in the business since. New Look is among a number of companies queuing up to join the stock market after last year's share rally and its progress will be watched closely. Aside from the difficult economic backdrop the retailer could also be hampered by the "Debenhams factor" – a reference to the department store's return to the market in 2006 after a spell in private equity ownership had left it burdened with debt and with stores in need of refurbishment. A series of profits warnings followed and the shares dived. One fund manager told Reuters news agency yesterday he had "no interest whatsoever" in New Look's IPO. He said it was "a fantastic company, but coming in at totally the wrong price for the debt structure". New Look also intends to open more stores in Europe, where it currently has 58 outlets, and more franchised outlets in locations like the Middle East and Russia, where there are currently 44 stores. McPhail said discount fashion was growing nearly four times as fast as the overall clothing market and New Look is growing far faster than its rival cheap chic retailers. Only 3% of sales come via the internet, said the New Look boss, and there was more opportunity online and in men's clothing and childrenswear, which could only be realised with more store space. The float will turn New Look's senior management into multimillionaires, on paper at least, as it is not yet known how many shares they might cash in. The senior executives own 16% of the group, shares which are likely to be worth nearly £300m. New Look's founder Tom Singh, who was part of the group which took the business private in 2004, owns a 22.5% stake, expected to be valued at some £400m.

Royal Bank leads the way as FTSE finishes on the front foot Shares in RBS ended up 2.56p at 34.86p despite earlier suggestions it had run into problems with the proposed $4bn sale of its jointly owned commodities business RBS Sempra to JPMorgan Chase. The talk was that President Obama's plans to stop proprietary trading by banks had forced JP Morgan to rethink its plans, and it might only buy the joint venture's oil operations and its non-US business. But even if that was the case, traders said RBS was likely to sell the rest - the US power and gas business - to its partner Sempra, and so would not be greatly disadvantaged. RBS has to sell the business following a ruling from the European Union. Meanwhile RBS played down talk it would sell and then lease back its flagship Scottish headquarters Gogarburn - the pet project of former chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin whose overambition led to the bank's near collapse until rescued by the UK taxpayer. An RBS spokesperson said: We constantly review all of our portfolio of property to ensure it is managed as efficiently as possible. Sale and leasebacks have been undertaken on many of our properties in the recent years but not for Gogarburn and we have no immediate plans to do so. European markets [posted] a second straight day of gains after investor confidence was boosted by better than expected earnings from Exxon Mobil and strong ISM manufacturing data. Markets have now gained two days in a row but it is too early to say that [they] are starting to stabilise after the last three weeks of losses. The key now will be whether investors build on positions and much of the start of tomorrow's session could be dictated by BP's fourth quarter earnings which are announced before the market opens. But David Buik at BGC Partners said: Frankly, today's session felt like a good old fashioned dead-cat-bounce. Since January 11, the FTSE 100 had fallen by the best part of 8% until this morning's opening. This was the first major correction we have seen since March last year – long overdue and very healthy. Northumbrian has been the subject of intermittent bid speculation in the past, and of course, there can be no guaranteed that a formal bid will materialise (Severn Trent and Pennon have also previously been rumoured to be targets). Current interest has apparently been sparked by the recent completion of Ofwat's regulatory price review for the period 2010-15. Northumbrian was one of the first to accept the industry regulator's final determination and has committed to increasing the dividend. The sector is likely to respond positively to any confirmation of renewed M&A activity. We can conclude...that there is little evidence that AHL is broken nor do we detect any palpable sense of panic from the AHL managers. There can be no guarantees that AHL's negative performance will end tomorrow but we do detect a belief from AHL that the investment environment will better suit their clean clear managed futures model in 2010 than it did in 2009. Meanwhile there was also talk it might be looking at London-based hedge fund manager Marshall Wace.

Corporate bond launch boosts savers Savers looking for a better return on their money will, for the first time, be able to invest in individual corporate bonds issued by major companies such as Tesco and BT, following today's launch of a trading service for private investors. Corporate bonds are a form of debt issued by companies to raise money, which pay a fixed rate of interest for a set period. They are generally considered less risky than shares, but more so than putting your cash in a savings account. The main risk for the buyer of an individual corporate bond is that the issuing company might get into financial difficulty or even go bust. Traditionally, this type of investment has only really been an option for big institutional investors because the minimum amount needed to trade was typically £50,000 or more. But now, at a time when savings rates are at an all-time low and many people are nervous about the stockmarket, individual investors with as little as £1,000 to invest – and, in one case, just £100 – will be able to access the corporate bond market. Initially, 10 bonds are available for trading issued by companies including Tesco, BT, National Grid, GlaxoSmithKline, Morgan Stanley, GE Capital and Enterprise Inns. There is also a bond issued by Royal Bank of Scotland specifically for the new service, which matures in February 2020 and pays 5.1%. This has a minimum investment of £100. Typically, investors will be able to trade the bonds in £1,000 chunks in the same way they would buy and sell shares. A spokesman for the LSE said the bond market had been launched "in response to strong private investor demand for greater access to fixed income". Many savings accounts are currently offering very poor returns. David Buik at City broker BGC Partners said: "3% is about as good as the individual will get, whereas with a company such as Tesco the interest on a seven-year bond would be closer to 5%." But he added: "There is obviously a credit risk which investors have to take into account. Potential investors also need to be mindful of the fact that we may well be at the end of a low interest rate cycle, so they need to be comfortable in their own mind that, say, 5% is a decent rate and that they are not too worried about holding on to bonds for a lengthy period of time." Speaking at the launch, Paul Killik, senior partner at stockbroker Killik and Co, said there had been growing demand from its private investor customers to access the corporate bond market, but until now a centralised, transparent order book for trading in "individual retail friendly-sized bonds" had not existed.

Pets at Home pulls rabbit out of hat with stock market hints They might have come close. The business model is hardly one to frighten conventional fund managers – out-of-town sheds, opening at a rate of 20 a year, in a market dominated by independent retailers. It's B&Q circa 1992, but with fluffy dog collars. So the choice for Pets' managers, whose 30% stake gives them a loud voice, was what form of ownership would they prefer – public company or private equity? In practice, the decision may have come down to their appetite for financial leverage. KKR will roughly double the debt in Pets to about £450m. That would be far too racy for the public market – the firm's turnover last year was only £404m. KKR clearly feels there are funds available at reasonable rates to make the arithmetic work (and, when even debt-riddled Manchester United can get a bond away at 9%-ish, it may be right). Nor can one criticise Pets chief executive Matt Davies for taking another trip on the private equity wagon: he is only 38, is probably banking a little cash, and can afford to take the higher-risk route. But it's a little depressing that the stock market is still viewed as the buyer of last resort.

Travelport to join the London market in £1.8bn float There has been a lot of talk about a flood of stock market flotations on the way this year, and today we get confirmation of a big one. Travelport was formed from Cendant's Galileo and GTA brands, which were bought by Blackstone, Technology Crossover Ventures and the company's management in 2006.
